The way Neil would describe a lot of the people Neil's met who have been long term unemployed is kind of defeated, kind of depressed	that’s not right	0
the Department of Work and Pensions did a survey of people who have been on benefits a couple of years ago	it is true	0
they found that 11% of people who were on benefits said that they felt fully justified being on benefits and have discovered that life without the added complication of work has much to recommend it	you’ve got about 30% of claimants who’ve got some sort of attitudinal problem	0
let’s not just call them ‘scroungers’	it is ‘scroungers	1

Before this recession, and forget whether Cameron is motivated by cuts or not, there was an ever increasingly welfare dependency	a lot of young people sort of, had a sense of entitlement, which wasn't very healthy	0
That’s not good	young people should go out and get something from the world, contribute something to the world. Instead of saying “Why can’t I get a well paid job? Why can’t I get a house?”	0
they should really be angry with their government for not addressing the underlying social policy issues	they shouldn’t be angry with young people who are making use of the welfare state	0
that’s fair enough	what we need is more houses	0
Claire wants to encourage a society that treats people as grown ups; that allows them to grow up	eighteen plus're kind of overgrown children	1
it sort of goes back to the hypothetical couple living with their parents that Cameron spoke about in his speech on Monday. This couple who will say to Romin that I’m very angry that Romin sees these other people	That’s not good	1

there’s certainly an argument to look at re-introducing a contributory principle back in to welfare.

xxx is how JB regards it	One of the confusing things in Britain is that actually the overwhelming majority of what we call ‘tax credits’, about 30 of the £33bn a year we spend on them is actually spent on stuff that’s actually not at all linked to being in work	3
that undermines the whole argument that you make about incentives	if you have become unemployed and you’ve paid in in the past, you’ll get a more generous rate of benefits than people who haven’t paid in	3

it is not	there is something distorting	3
Romin is overstating Romin's case, and at the same time treating young people as though they won’t cope with living in a garret, bit of poverty but I’ll get by	At this current time, the current context without social housing, with 5 million people on social housing waiting lists, people - of course they should claim housing benefit, if they are unable to pay what are extortionate rents.

We need to think much harder about how we can make the benefit system, the whole welfare state much more activating, how we can help to get those people into work	we’ve had the benefits, whatever they are, from our family of being set up in such a way that we understand the world of working and how to get on in life	3

there is very great danger here of stirring up resentment towards people who need welfare to keep house and home together	it’s a very good point, Clifford’s just put Clifford's finger on it, about the fourth undeserving child or however many you want to put on the State’s payroll	3
it creates these disincentives	that would be great	3
that majority doesn't include CL	there’s quite a substantial element of blame of the people who are so called ‘undeserving’, even if Neil doesn't accept the term	3
these programs from other countries, they work	we never properly put that into operation	3
we should move towards a system which is more based on what you deserve	the fourth child in David Cameron’s Chinese style three-child policy is not undeserving	3
I certainly get indirect effects; indirect goods.	it is true	3
in itself this is undesirable	We’d still be much better off	3
we have to starve people	If you’re staying on your mates coach and all the rest of it, and you get a job, you want to prove that you’re going to not just kind of go “Oh well, it’s not that much money.” You’ll use it, that’s what you want.	3
If the market doesn’t, for whatever reason never mind who’s fault it is, then the next thing that the government should do, is to provide jobs for these people to do	They go up, they go down	3
abolishing housing benefit for under 25s will lead to staying with your mates	this argument as benefits somehow taking people out of jobs, or disincentivising people simply doesn’t work	3
They go up, they go down	that is fair	3
it leads to a dependency which may in itself just not be a good way to live, or not be a good thing to pass on to your children.	we’ve seen millions of people claiming incapacity benefit, being dependent on benefits, young people have a sense of entitlement from the state, rather than a sense of self-reliance	3
if you have become unemployed and you’ve paid in in the past, you’ll get a more generous rate of benefits than people who haven’t paid in	child tax credit is just like a much more generous version of child benefit	3
there seemed to be a germ of a compassion about what James was saying	there is an internal failure in some cases	3
We’d still be much better off	what we need to look at is we need to look at other ways of incentivising; making work pay. Looking at the barriers that exist for young people to get into work	3
let’s not just call them ‘scroungers’	individuals are not  feckless and lazy	3
they shouldn't resort to petty crime, rather than take benefits	JB: did not take adversarial position towards the poor unfortunate people who’ve been trapped in the trap	3
If it’s low paid. If it’s very poor conditions, if you have to drive, if you can’t look after your children, if it causes damage to your health; then it is	the reality is that in the last ten or twenty years there’s been a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, and from the young to the old, and that what Neil's really trying to do is to justify that by blaming the poor for their position	3
therefore [you are going to provide money to these people	It’s due to a triple crisis	3
It is a safety net	That’s how JB regards it	3
even if you incentivise people in those sort of way, the casualty can be the really innocent – the children	JB wants to get rid of the welfare state, the welfare system	3
in a situation, rather than taking benefits, rather than giving a speech, what I should do is I’ll do anything. I’ll take any bits and jobs I’ll do anything because I’m not going to be dependent, either on my parents or on the State; I want to grow up, be independent. I don’t want to be beholden to the State. I don’t want to sit there passively, and I’ll take a low paid, part time job	it takes a very simple view	3
At this current time, the current context without social housing, with 5 million people on social housing waiting lists, people - of course they should claim housing benefit, if they are unable to pay what are extortionate rents. Particularly in places like London	JB: did not take adversarial position towards the poor unfortunate people who’ve been trapped in the trap	3
it builds your character	Nothing JB said implies that JB regards it as a crime	3
In the same way that in other countries which run well and efficient welfare states, have very low unemployment – much lower than we do – it would be as low, or lower as it is there	you say, “You get benefits on the basis that you work.”	3
Anne's completely misunderstood the point of housing benefit	Royal Mail ran a scheme at Christmas, applying for seasonal work	3
it is also very much a trap	we could turn our tax credits, which aren’t really tax credits in the UK, into something you only get paid if you’re working	3
that does seem to correspond to the reality	JB doesn't know whether it is innate or not	3
RS makes xxx of Mr Cameron’s point that paying young people to move out of their parents’ home doesn’t mean they’re independent, they’re just dependent on other people’s parents	we have to starve people	3
a carrot and a stick approach to welfare state won't actually solve them	Clifford had quite an entertaining discussion with James	3
we never properly put that into operation	they can’t get full time work	3
there are lots of ways in which we can change our welfare state to make it better	the system, if it has an impact, has an impact	3
James is pretty clear cut, has pretty clear arguments, whether you agreed with them or not	Romin is overstating Romin's case, and at the same time treating young people as though they won’t cope with living in a garret, bit of poverty but I’ll get by	3
If you’re going to work very hard for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and you’re going to make only £1 more than you would have made on benefits the urge to get a job is not as strong as it would be if you’d otherwise be penniless	it sort of goes back to the hypothetical couple living with their parents that Cameron spoke about in his speech on Monday. This couple who will say to Romin that I’m very angry that Romin sees these other people	3
xxx is the sort of conditionality; or sort of duties RS would expect people on benefit to undertake, in return for that support	we never properly put that into operation	3
If they’re going to be of working age, able bodied, and if they’re going to get benefits; they should not be allowed just to sit at home on benefits	that’s a crucial difference	3
child tax credit is just like a much more generous version of child benefit	I certainly get indirect effects; indirect goods.	3
that’s fair enough	the old idea of welfarism as a safety net, has changed	3
these things are in some sort of a balance	If that’s the kind of job system that Neil wants, it seems to be a deeply immoral way of dealing with the quest of work, and how people should look at work	3
you got a choice of being mollycoddled at home by your mum and dad, or you demand that you’re sustained by the State	last year 93% of new claimants were in a household in which somebody worked	3
The welfare state that we have at the moment here lacks a sense of ‘just desert’	the reality is that in the last ten or twenty years there’s been a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, and from the young to the old, and that what Neil's really trying to do is to justify that by blaming the poor for their position	3
that is not a particularly moral position to take	If it’s low paid. If it’s very poor conditions, if you have to drive, if you can’t look after your children, if it causes damage to your health; then it is	3
at no time before the welfare state, was there mass permanent unemployment	a housing crisis, billions wasted on housing benefit lining the pockets of wealthy landlords because we stopped building social housing	3
There’s 5 million people languishing on social housing waiting lists	that’s part of the way God made people	3
AM doesn't quite understand what RS's real criticism is of what Mr Cameron was saying	there’s two questions here	3
lots of people are doing part time work	It doesn’t go to the tenant	3
lots of people are doing part time work	that is fair	3
If we don’t give more benefits, more welfare, we’re going to end up with homeless young people everywhere, destitution and so on	what’s happened is, there’s been a huge and permanent increase in the number of people who are unemployed	3
Claire wants to encourage a society that treats people as grown ups; that allows them to grow up	you don’t get round everything about what you should about welfare dependency and welfarism by just saying “Well I’m sorry, but I can’t deliver the revolution tomorrow.”	3
we’ve thought too much, funnily, about the financial incentives to work, and not enough about the conditionality in the system	people are naturally creative and industrious, and want to work	3
There are a number of people competing for work	If the market doesn’t, for whatever reason it’s because of the failure of Capitalism	3
Over a million people, young people, without work, it has a scarring impact	that’s very dangerous to the solidarity, which civilization requires	3
that’s part of the way God made people	unemployment comes about on a mass permanent scale entirely because of the welfare state	3
a housing crisis, billions wasted on housing benefit lining the pockets of wealthy landlords because we stopped building social housing	Britain actually is quite unusual internationally	3
abolishing housing benefit for under 25s will lead to homelessness, hidden homelessness, sofa surfing, staying with the wrong people	you don’t just start having children, without your other circumstances being taken into account	3
people are naturally creative and industrious, and want to work	there’s always a problem with any moral argument that says there is an innate desire to do things	3
It creates a dependency on work	one of the things that RS picked up when he was listening in the green room was about this idea of this demoralisation	3
it would be wonderful if politicians could just snap their fingers and create millions of jobs	if there were twice as many jobs available, unemployment would fall drastically	3
The reason that the number of people on benefits has soared, is simply because the jobs that once existed disappeared	a housing crisis, billions wasted on housing benefit lining the pockets of wealthy landlords because we stopped building social housing	3
there has not been a transfer	that’s a crucial difference	3
there is something distorting	we have to bribe people	3
some people are not working because they can make a penny more from giving up their job and living at home	Clifford had quite an entertaining discussion with James	3
if there were twice as many jobs available, unemployment would fall drastically	In a sense he’s very similar to the abolition of the Board and Lodgings Allowance that Margaret Thatcher brought in at the end of the ‘80s, which obviously saw a huge spike in rough sleeping	3
these programs from other countries, they work	there are too many people included in those categories	3
there is not a danger that we’ll actually make things worse	there are other things that the taxpayers get back from the welfare state.	3
it's not only the right to a job that RS'd accept	many people are working who get it	3
there is something distorting	It is a safety net	3
The real question is to ask “What is the best welfare state we can make, in the real world?”	there is an internal failure in some cases	3
the welfare state system is creating a whole class of work shy, people who are incentivised not to work	we do need to get back to this idea of desert	3
there’s two questions here	They go up, they go down	3
some people are not working because they can make a penny more from giving up their job and living at home	The way Neil would describe a lot of the people Neil's met who have been long term unemployed is kind of defeated, kind of depressed	3
JB would want to abolish the welfare state altogether	there’s a short-term relationship, but no necessarily a long term one	3
abolishing housing benefit for under 25s will lead to staying with your mates	the urge to get a job is overwhelming	3
there seemed to be a germ of compassion about what Neil was saying	there is a distorting effect on whether you’re prepared to go into training, whether you will go back in to the labour market; on what terms you’re prepared to take a job	3
there is very great danger here of stirring up resentment towards people who need welfare to keep house and home together	we ask people to do nothing in return for their benefits	3
they shouldn’t be angry with young people who are making use of the welfare state	some people are not working because they can make a penny more from giving up their job and living at home	3
we ask people to do nothing in return for their benefits	they want the relationships that go with work	3
witnesses don't have an answer to that	some people have an innate desire, so called, to work harder than others	3
the idea that people should take any job at any wages, any conditions is an immoral position to take	it's not only the right to a job that RS'd accept	3
We need to think much harder about how we can make the benefit system, the whole welfare state much more activating, how we can help to get those people into work	welfarism has become an all consuming be all and end all for a significant minority of society	3
there has not been a transfer	If they’re going to be of working age, able bodied, and if they’re going to get benefits; they should not be allowed just to sit at home on benefits	3
incentives and compulsions are irrelevant.	that majority doesn't include CL	3
incentives and compulsions are irrelevant.	that’s begging a lot of questions	3
witnesses don't have an answer to that	There is plenty of evidence to say that there is depression amongst the unemployed.	3
the argument that Anne was raising “Let’s not talk about externalities, let’s talk about internalities” as it were, misses the point	you’ve got about 30% of claimants who’ve got some sort of attitudinal problem	3
It’s not overwhelming	This guy’s just a scrounger, he needs a kick up the backside to get going	3
there is a problem	they shouldn't resort to petty crime, rather than take benefits	3
what we need to look at is we need to look at other ways of incentivising; making work pay. Looking at the barriers that exist for young people to get into work	the State is subsidising employers who refuse to pay people decent wages	3
that’s not right	the system, if it has an impact, has an impact	3
We need to think much harder about how we can make the benefit system, the whole welfare state much more activating, how we can help to get those people into work	eighteen plus're kind of overgrown children	3
there are lots of ways in which you can hopefully allow the market to create jobs	We need to think much harder about how we can make the benefit system, the whole welfare state much more activating, how we can help to get those people into work	3
Merthyr Tydfil, in Wales has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country	Royal Mail ran a scheme at Christmas, applying for seasonal work	3
welfarism has become an all consuming be all and end all for a significant minority of society	we do not have the social circumstances to provide that for our young people.	3
Britain actually is quite unusual internationally	they want the relationships that go with work	3
abolishing housing benefit for under 25s will lead to homelessness, hidden homelessness, sofa surfing, staying with the wrong people	Owen seems to be finding every which way not to answer Anne's very sensible question	3
welfarism has become an all consuming be all and end all for a significant minority of society	it's not only the right to a job that RS'd accept	3
that would be great	youth unemployment is a blight on our nation	3
It’s been done to them, not done by them	they’re not naturally lazy	3
the welfare state, as it is, is a safety net / is a trap	They’re far more likely as a result to be unemployed in later life	3
it’s compulsion	That is not the world we live in	3
If people want to work, if it’s their nature to work, and if the work was there, then they’d go and do it	If you took the people around this table this evening, and you took away all of our contacts, our qualifications our great jobs and so on, we’d still have more internal resources than that guy	3
there is very great danger here of stirring up resentment towards people who need welfare to keep house and home together	It’s not overwhelming	3
This is often a working benefit	That’s the English public school version of morality	3
Romin is overstating Romin's case, and at the same time treating young people as though they won’t cope with living in a garret, bit of poverty but I’ll get by	Nothing JB said implies that JB regards it as a crime	3
the problem is that welfarism has gone far beyond a safety net, or anything compassionate	JB's never referred to them being work shy	3
people would require the social context in which work happens	it’s going back to the politics of the poor house	3
if the welfare state did not exist and you became unemployed, and you rely on your friends and family to get by, and then someone comes along and offers you a job but it doesn’t give you more money than your family and friends are going. We would still expect you to take that job	It’s so unnatural	3
there is not a danger that we’ll actually make things worse	many people are working who get it	3
JB  wouldn’t use the word ‘moral’	the current debate is about deflecting debate from those failures onto the supposed moral fecklessness of individuals	3
AM doesn't know what RS's solution would be if he didn’t go that way	That’s the English public school version of morality	3
Claire's no evidence for Claire's assertions	xxx is how we move from a policy that we’ve been pursuing for quite a long time, of trying to fight poverty mainly by giving people more in cash benefits, which solves the problem today, to a policy which is more about solving the problem over the long run by moving more people into work, reducing unemployment	3
people like KM who believe as a utopia, are precisely the ones who have led to bad policies and bad results.	that would be great	3
it takes a very simple view	CF is interested in the demoralising impact of welfarism 	3
In Wisconsin, when they made this requirement, and they gave a lot of help to people in terms of childcare A]; [in Wisconsin they had a reduction in welfare roles of up to 90%	they shouldn’t be angry with young people who are making use of the welfare state	3
what’s happened is, there’s been a huge and permanent increase in the number of people who are unemployed	you don’t need to be working to claim it	3
there are other things that the taxpayers get back from the welfare state.	it is / is not moral to ask people to work in a job that doesn’t really pay them that much more than being on benefits	3
If we don’t give more benefits, more welfare, we’re going to end up with homeless young people everywhere, destitution and so on	it’s requirement	3
nearly two million people t working tax credit, which means that they are in jobs which are so badly paid that they can’t survive, that they require benefits	The real question is to ask “What is the best welfare state we can make, in the real world?”	3
it’s a very good point, Clifford’s just put Clifford's finger on it, about the fourth undeserving child or however many you want to put on the State’s payroll	It’s also not the case that the idea of independence from the State, and character building is confined to the English public school system	3
there is such a lot of evidence that it does have a distorting effect	there seemed to be a germ of compassion about what Neil was saying	3
This is often a working benefit	Britain actually is quite unusual internationally	3
JB would want to abolish the welfare state altogether	in the media there is quite a lot of blame	3
when people try to make a distinction between the deserving and the less deserving claimants, some people then kick up about it	We need to think much harder about how we can make the benefit system, the whole welfare state much more activating, how we can help to get those people into work	3
the young guy wasn’t turning up to work on time	we don’t want to blame them for that	3
the young guy’d lost his job at Tesco	JB would want to abolish the welfare state altogether	3
Young people nowadays, you know who have just sat their GCSEs or just sat their A Levels, have far fewer opportunities than their parents generations.	James was blaming the system	3
in a situation where you’re looking after kids. Out of pride, you don't say “Well I’m not going to take benefits and force my children to suffer as a consequence of my own stubbornness.” 	xxx is how JB regards it	3
we do need to get back to this idea of desert	this argument as benefits somehow taking people out of jobs, or disincentivising people simply doesn’t work	3
Young people nowadays, you know who have just sat their GCSEs or just sat their A Levels, have far fewer opportunities than their parents generations.	a high proportion of people are desperate to work, that work on such low wages that they have to have benefits in order to top them up	3
Anne's misunderstood the nature of housing benefit	JB  wouldn’t use the word ‘moral’	3
there has to be a bottom line beyond which it turns into outright exploitation	it creates these disincentives	3
welfarism has become an all consuming be all and end all for a significant minority of society	the Department of Work and Pensions did a survey of people who have been on benefits a couple of years ago	3
In a sense he’s very similar to the abolition of the Board and Lodgings Allowance that Margaret Thatcher brought in at the end of the ‘80s, which obviously saw a huge spike in rough sleeping	individuals are feckless and lazy	3
One of the confusing things in Britain is that actually the overwhelming majority of what we call ‘tax credits’, about 30 of the £33bn a year we spend on them is actually spent on stuff that’s actually not at all linked to being in work	There are a number of people competing for work	3
that’s not right	let’s not just call them ‘scroungers’	3
the urge to get a job is overwhelming	we spend about £20 billion as a nation on housing benefit	3
they should do xxx in order to look after their children	this actually has a fine tradition elsewhere	3
JB  wouldn’t use the word ‘moral’	JB didn’t say “Work shy”	3
JB wants to get rid of the welfare state, the welfare system	James made this very clear – James wasn’t blaming individuals	3
In the same way that in other countries which run well and efficient welfare states, have very low unemployment – much lower than we do – it would be as low, or lower as it is there	people would require the social context in which work happens	3
instead of wasting it lining the pockets of landlords it could be used to build housing which would stimulate the economy, create jobs, bring down the welfare bill, and bring down the social housing waiting lis	If people want to work, if it’s their nature to work, and if the work was there, then they’d go and do it	3
James made this very clear – James wasn’t blaming individuals	that’s not their fault	3
there is not a danger that we’ll actually make things worse	that’s a crucial difference	3
JB didn’t refer to utopia	Neil's not trying to justify anything	3
when people try to make a distinction between the deserving and the less deserving claimants, some people then kick up about it	The real question is to ask “What is the best welfare state we can make, in the real world?”	3
If it were politically possible, JB would / would not want to abolish the welfare state altogether	JB didn't say that	3
There’s historically been some resistance from ordinary working class people to actually taking state benefits	That’s how JB regards it	3
Owen hasn't answered Anne's question	the sense of individual self-reliance, and standing on your own two feet and doing everything to avoid taking money from the state has not been chipped away at by the growth of welfarism	3
abolishing housing benefit for under 25s will lead to homelessness, hidden homelessness, sofa surfing, staying with the wrong people	that would be great	3
the problem is they are often in low paid work	People have a moral duty to work to support themselves	3
it does need reform	they’re not naturally lazy	3
it’s an interesting thought experiment to say that the young could survive on their own, because they’ve got the get up and go, and we should let the witnesses at it, is worth considering	we’ve had the benefits, whatever they are, from our family of being set up in such a way that we understand the world of working and how to get on in life	3
That’s how JB regards it	these people don't exist	3
Housing benefit has not a debilitating ?effect	JB's no idea whether it’s innate	3
nearly two million people t working tax credit, which means that they are in jobs which are so badly paid that they can’t survive, that they require benefits	in itself there is / is not a danger there	3
therefore [you are going to provide money to these people	What is important at this point is that there has to be a serious discussion about the impact of welfarism	3
when rents are soaring, they can’t afford to pay their rent.	in a situation, rather than taking benefits, rather than giving a speech, what I should do is I’ll do anything. I’ll take any bits and jobs I’ll do anything because I’m not going to be dependent, either on my parents or on the State; I want to grow up, be independent. I don’t want to be beholden to the State. I don’t want to sit there passively, and I’ll take a low paid, part time job	3
the young guy wasn’t turning up to work on time	That’s the English public school version of morality	3
there has not been a transfer	when it reduces by 90%- what Neil meant is that they were all in low paid, part time jobs	3
the Department of Work and Pensions did a survey of people who have been on benefits a couple of years ago	the State is already helping them	3
Britain actually is quite unusual internationally	KM didn’t ask JB that	3
the Department of Work and Pensions did a survey of people who have been on benefits a couple of years ago	they’re not naturally lazy	3
there is a problem	in itself this is undesirable	3
the idea behind it was that it would be for periods of sporadic unemployment	That was the way our system was supposed to work as well	3
It’s creative	It’s not incentives	3
Kenyan cannot just do little policy bits to get Kenan off the argument	you can see the curves moving together	3
It’s not beyond the imagination to imagine the young might get up and go and do something about this, other than kind of sit and wait to be handed something.	Owen hasn't answered Anne's question	3
you’ve got about 30% of claimants who’ve got some sort of attitudinal problem	people like KM who believe as a utopia, are precisely the ones who have led to bad policies and bad results.	3
JB's never referred to them being work shy	we’ve thought too much, funnily, about the financial incentives to work, and not enough about the conditionality in the system	3
that is neither a moral nor a practical way forward	this argument as benefits somehow taking people out of jobs, or disincentivising people simply doesn’t work	3
the desire to work is innate	it builds your character	3
If you’re staying on your mates coach and all the rest of it, and you get a job, you want to prove that you’re going to not just kind of go “Oh well, it’s not that much money.” You’ll use it, that’s what you want.	There’s 5 million people languishing on social housing waiting lists	3
it does need reform	RS's kind of treating them as though they’re passive recipients of something	3
there are too many people included in those categories	At this current time, the current context without social housing, with 5 million people on social housing waiting lists, people - of course they should claim housing benefit, if they are unable to pay what are extortionate rents. Particularly in places like London	3
incentives are irrelevant	a punitive welfare state, a welfare state which attempts to socially engineer, attempts to prod and poke people ‘carrot and stick’ into work, is not sufficient to break this apparent perceived cycle	3
One is to change the balance of or the generosity of out of work beneifts, maybe spend more on in work benefits like tax credits and so on	If you look at the wider measure of all the people on benefits: the people on incapacity benefit, the people on income support as well. Actually, even all the way through the years of the debt fuelled boom we had about 5 million people effectively workless	3
the welfare state, as it is, is a safety net / is a trap	If there were twice as many jobs available than there are now, unemployment would fall drastically	3
Britain is actually very unusual compared to other countries	they should just get on the bus to Cardiff	3
we’ve done a lot to improve work incentives financially	incentives are irrelevant	3
people are incentivised to remain unemployed	when it reduces by 90%- what Neil meant is that they were all in low paid, part time jobs	3
That is not the world we live in	there are lots of ways in which you can hopefully allow the market to create jobs	3
Owen wants to take housing benefit down	The problem isn’t lack of employment	3
Romin is overstating Romin's case, and at the same time treating young people as though they won’t cope with living in a garret, bit of poverty but I’ll get by	Anne's misunderstood the nature of housing benefit	3
there is a natural and normal desire to work	JB didn’t say “Work shy”	3
that would be a good way of incentivising work	unemployment comes about on a mass permanent scale entirely because of the welfare state	3
it’s these broader circumstances that we really need to get to the nub of	that is a worthwhile ambition	3
We kidded ourselves during the last decade that we’d solved the problem of unemployment,	you must require them to work	3
they are right about that	The problem isn’t lack of employment	3
the young guy was smoking a lot of spliff	In most other countries there’s something like an unemployment insurance	3
That worries CL very much	they were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of young people, desperate for work	3
that is fair	It creates a dependency on work	3
there is a natural and normal desire to work	you can’t blame the people who are rationally taking housing benefit when they can’t afford to pay their rent	3
The reason that the number of people on benefits has soared, is simply because the jobs that once existed disappeared	Anne's misunderstood the nature of housing benefit	3
it’s a very good point, Clifford’s just put Clifford's finger on it, about the fourth undeserving child or however many you want to put on the State’s payroll	they should really be angry with their government for not addressing the underlying social policy issues	3
it clearly shows that Cameron hasn’t learnt any lesson from the past	it is not the equivalent of calling people feckless and lazy to say that a lot of young people have become so dependent that they say `Why should I take that job? I don't want to get up that early.''	3
we should not talk about externalities, we should talk about internalities	there’s certainly a point that welfare spending in this country is too high	3
the State is subsidising employers who refuse to pay people decent wages	xxx is how we move from a policy that we’ve been pursuing for quite a long time, of trying to fight poverty mainly by giving people more in cash benefits, which solves the problem today, to a policy which is more about solving the problem over the long run by moving more people into work, reducing unemployment	3
the problem is that welfarism has gone far beyond a safety net, or anything compassionate	what’s happened is, there’s been a huge and permanent increase in the number of people who are unemployed	3
if you took something like ‘welfare to work’ set up by a Democrat American president who simply thought that too many people in the underclass were getting trapped in a dependency that wasn’t good for them, wasn’t good for their children, he was also being too punitive	that majority includes / does not include CL	3
it’s a very good point, Clifford’s just put Clifford's finger on it, about the fourth undeserving child or however many you want to put on the State’s payroll	child tax credit is just like a much more generous version of child benefit	3
It does work up to a point insofar that the introduction of tax credits did move some groups, particularly lone parents, that helped to get more of them into employment	it's not innate	3
that’s overstating it	RS's kind of treating them as though they’re passive recipients of something	3
RS makes xxx of Mr Cameron’s point that paying young people to move out of their parents’ home doesn’t mean they’re independent, they’re just dependent on other people’s parents	that’s not their fault	3
‘The Daily Telegraph’ pointed out there are 23 people chasing every job in this country	that does seem to correspond to the reality	3
It’s not incentives	housing benefit, particularly when paid out very young to so many young people, has a debilitating-	3
In Wisconsin, when they made this requirement, and they gave a lot of help to people in terms of childcare A]; [in Wisconsin they had a reduction in welfare roles of up to 90%	they enjoy that	3
we spend about £20 billion as a nation on housing benefit	housing benefit, particularly when paid out very young to so many young people, has a debilitating-	3
some people are not working because they can make a penny more from giving up their job and living at home	If we don’t give more benefits, more welfare, we’re going to end up with homeless young people everywhere, destitution and so on	3
people are not naturally work shy	It doesn’t go to the tenant	3
that’s part of the way God made people	the fundamental duty we have as a society towards the unemployed is to make sure there are enough jobs for them to take the opportunity to go and work	3
there is a distorting effect on whether you’re prepared to go into training, whether you will go back in to the labour market; on what terms you’re prepared to take a job	what we need is more houses	3
let’s not just call them ‘scroungers’	what’s happened is, there’s been a huge and permanent increase in the number of people who are unemployed	3
James is pretty clear cut, has pretty clear arguments, whether you agreed with them or not	they should really be angry with their government for not addressing the underlying social policy issues	3
that argument is even stronger if the people you’re relying on are not your friends and family, but other people you don’t even know	there is a lack of recognition that there’s anything sapping away at the moral of young people in particular, who are dependent on the State.	3
that’s not necessarily how the welfare state was ever intended to work, or the way it does work	there is an internal failure in some cases	3
it’s not particularly attractive	KM didn’t ask JB that	3
there’s a short-term relationship, but no necessarily a long term one	let’s not just call them ‘scroungers’	3
we’re not going to get rid of the welfare state	in itself there is / is not a danger there	3
There is plenty of evidence to say that there is depression amongst the unemployed.	it’s an interesting thought experiment to say that the young could survive on their own, because they’ve got the get up and go, and we should let the witnesses at it, is worth considering	3
the welfare state should be about what people need/what they deserve	the Department of Work and Pensions did a survey of people who have been on benefits a couple of years ago	3
if you have become unemployed and you’ve paid in in the past, you’ll get a more generous rate of benefits than people who haven’t paid in	abolishing housing benefit for under 25s will lead to staying with your mates	3
Before this recession, and forget whether Cameron is motivated by cuts or not, there was an ever increasingly welfare dependency	it must be the day job	3
it must be the day job	a punitive welfare state, a welfare state which attempts to socially engineer, attempts to prod and poke people ‘carrot and stick’ into work, is not sufficient to break this apparent perceived cycle	3
The way Neil would describe a lot of the people Neil's met who have been long term unemployed is kind of defeated, kind of depressed	it is ‘scroungers	3
that’s what William Beveridge wanted when he was designing the welfare state	JB wants to get rid of the welfare state, the welfare system	3
If people want to work, if it’s their nature to work, and if the work was there, then they’d go and do it	There is plenty of evidence to say that there is depression amongst the unemployed.	3
JB didn’t refer to utopia	housing benefit, particularly when paid out very young to so many young people, has a debilitating-	3
There is plenty of evidence to say that there is depression amongst the unemployed.	they really reduce unemployment	3
CF is not interested in Cameron making cuts	Anne's completely misunderstood the point of housing benefit	3
we need to encourage young people to see a third way, an alternative to that	that does seem to correspond to the reality	3
only since the welfare state has there been permanent unemployment	in itself this is undesirable	3
There is no natural condition of unemployment	a punitive welfare state, a welfare state which attempts to socially engineer, attempts to prod and poke people ‘carrot and stick’ into work, is not sufficient to break this apparent perceived cycle	3
a lot of young people sort of, had a sense of entitlement, which wasn't very healthy	the moral problem is that of how to provide incentives to get people off welfare, into work	3
it’s a very good point, Clifford’s just put Clifford's finger on it, about the fourth undeserving child or however many you want to put on the State’s payroll	it is not	3
we ask people to do nothing in return for their benefits	The problem isn’t lack of employment	3
it sort of goes back to the hypothetical couple living with their parents that Cameron spoke about in his speech on Monday. This couple who will say to Romin that I’m very angry that Romin sees these other people	If it were politically possible, JB would / would not want to abolish the welfare state altogether	3
they really reduce unemployment	the State is already helping them	3
you don’t get round everything about what you should about welfare dependency and welfarism by just saying “Well I’m sorry, but I can’t deliver the revolution tomorrow.”	The welfare state that we have at the moment here lacks a sense of ‘just desert’	3
If that’s the kind of job system that Neil wants, it seems to be a deeply immoral way of dealing with the quest of work, and how people should look at work	We can’t start dividing the population between the deserving and the undeserving	3
the current debate is about deflecting debate from those failures onto the supposed moral fecklessness of individuals	If people want to work, if it’s their nature to work, and if the work was there, then they’d go and do it	3
since this government’s come to power they’ve tried to exploit tensions in working class Britain between the working poor and the unemployed; between the non-disabled and the disabled; between private sector workers and public sector workers	we were just looking at the claimant count, a very narrow measure of unemployment	3
unemployment is a crime not a personal tragedy	Claire's no evidence for Claire's assertions	3
these programs from other countries, they work	there is a no utopia	3
politicians are not taking a moral stance over welfare reform	It’s creative	3
The real question is to ask “What is the best welfare state we can make, in the real world?”	There’s no free education	3
there’s the rub	the growth of what Claire calls ‘welfarism’ is to do with, firstly the disappearance of so many skilled middle income jobs; and secondly due to the failure to build social housing	3
we do not have the social circumstances to provide that for our young people.	it is not	3
That’s how JB regards it	a housing crisis, billions wasted on housing benefit lining the pockets of wealthy landlords because we stopped building social housing	3
that majority doesn't include CL	Neil's not trying to justify anything	3
it’s fair	people would require the social context in which work happens	3
the growth of what Claire calls ‘welfarism’ is to do with, firstly the disappearance of so many skilled middle income jobs; and secondly due to the failure to build social housing	Before this recession, and forget whether Cameron is motivated by cuts or not, there was an ever increasingly welfare dependency	3
It’s not overwhelming	it sort of goes back to the hypothetical couple living with their parents that Cameron spoke about in his speech on Monday. This couple who will say to Romin that I’m very angry that Romin sees these other people	3
it’s a problem that the sense of individual self-reliance, and standing on your own two feet and actually doing everything to avoid taking money from the state because you want to be politically independent and morally and individually independent has been sapped away at, chipped away at by the growth of welfarsim	In one of the US states that went the furthest in this in diverting people from being on welfare, they managed at one point to reduce the number of people on benefits by 90%	3
The problem with compelling people to work, is that it suggests that the problem is that people do not wish to work	many people are working who get it	3
that does seem to correspond to the reality	Before this recession, and forget whether Cameron is motivated by cuts or not, there was an ever increasingly welfare dependency	3
James made this very clear – James wasn’t blaming individuals	the system, if it has an impact, has an impact	3
there is a no utopia	There are benefits to work, obviously self-esteem, aspiration, sort of intangible goods which individuals feel	3
This is a huge opportunity that we’ve barely begun to explore in the UK system	one of the things that RS picked up when he was listening in the green room was about this idea of this demoralisation	3
they are right about that	we are just providing the work that people want to do	3
they were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of young people, desperate for work	individuals are not  feckless and lazy	3
that is not a particularly moral position to take	witnesses don't have an answer to that	3
in a situation where you’re looking after kids. Out of pride, you don't say “Well I’m not going to take benefits and force my children to suffer as a consequence of my own stubbornness.” 	What we do need to think about, are people’s incentives, and how you set up people’s incentives in the right way, that people do the right things	3
the young guy was smoking a lot of spliff	People move, in a life course, move in and out of work	3
JB's never referred to them being work shy	the Department of Work and Pensions did a survey of people who have been on benefits a couple of years ago	3
welfarism has become an all consuming be all and end all for a significant minority of society	JB didn’t refer to utopia	3
That’s the difference	Before this recession, and forget whether Cameron is motivated by cuts or not, there was an ever increasingly welfare dependency	3
that’s begging a lot of questions	it’s a very good point, Clifford’s just put Clifford's finger on it, about the fourth undeserving child or however many you want to put on the State’s payroll	3
They’re far more likely as a result to be unemployed in later life	Neil's not trying to justify anything	3
If that’s the kind of job system that Neil wants, it seems to be a deeply immoral way of dealing with the quest of work, and how people should look at work	At this current time, the current context without social housing, with 5 million people on social housing waiting lists, people - of course they should claim housing benefit, if they are unable to pay what are extortionate rents. Particularly in places like London	3
the sense of individual self-reliance, and standing on your own two feet and doing everything to avoid taking money from the state has not been chipped away at by the growth of welfarism	it is the knock down argument	3
it’s moved the furthest away of any of the industrialised countries from a contributory system where what you’ve paid in is what you get out	that argument is even stronger if the people you’re relying on are not your friends and family, but other people you don’t even know	3
we were just looking at the claimant count, a very narrow measure of unemployment	some people are not working because they can make a penny more from giving up their job and living at home	3
the young guy wasn’t turning up to work on time	we actually encourage people to become dependent on the state	3
There’s historically been some resistance from ordinary working class people to actually taking state benefits	If you took the people around this table this evening, and you took away all of our contacts, our qualifications our great jobs and so on, we’d still have more internal resources than that guy	3
there are lots of ways in which you can hopefully allow the market to create jobs	JB didn't say he wants to get rid of the welfare state, the welfare system	3
Kenyan cannot just do little policy bits to get Kenan off the argument	xxx is how we encourage the young	3
Anne misunderstands how housing benefit works	it’s only the right to a job that RS’d accept	3
one of the big initiatives that Romin's looking at, is the troubled families initiative; this idea that this hardcore of really difficult families that we need to look at	there’s two questions here	3
the old idea of welfarism as a safety net, has changed	 that is not enough	3
Anne's misunderstood the nature of housing benefit	there is a natural and normal desire to work	3
what we need to look at is we need to look at other ways of incentivising; making work pay. Looking at the barriers that exist for young people to get into work	it’s to do with a bunch of lazy scroungers dribbling on their sofas watching reflections of themselves on Jeremy Kyle	3
politicians are not taking a moral stance over welfare reform	abolishing housing benefit for under 25s will lead to homelessness, hidden homelessness, sofa surfing, staying with the wrong people	3
they should do xxx in order to look after their children	if there were twice as many jobs available, unemployment would fall drastically	3
people can be tempted out of work	I want to live in a London that doesn’t have high levels of crime	3
Kenyan cannot just do little policy bits to get Kenan off the argument	Owen wants to take housing benefit down	3
they are somehow or another demoralized and broken	the sense of individual self-reliance, and standing on your own two feet and doing everything to avoid taking money from the state has not been chipped away at by the growth of welfarism	3
there’s been a transfer	Owen is the champion of the working class	3
It’s also not the case that the idea of independence from the State, and character building is confined to the English public school system	If people want to work, if it’s their nature to work, and if the work was there, then they’d go and do it	3
KM didn’t ask JB that	you don’t get round everything about what you should about welfare dependency and welfarism by just saying “Well I’m sorry, but I can’t deliver the revolution tomorrow.”	3
that argument is even stronger if the people you’re relying on are not your friends and family, but other people you don’t even know	JB likens it to a mouse trap which has a rather stale piece of cheese in it	3
you say, “You get benefits on the basis that you work.”	that’s begging a lot of questions	3
Claire wants to encourage a society that treats people as grown ups; that allows them to grow up	we actually encourage people to become dependent on the state	3
they enjoy that	We have a minimum wage	3
the urge to get a job is overwhelming	there is a natural and normal desire to work	3
young people should go out and get something from the world, contribute something to the world. Instead of saying “Why can’t I get a well paid job? Why can’t I get a house?”	there seemed to be a germ of compassion about what Neil was saying	3
that’s not necessarily how the welfare state was ever intended to work, or the way it does work	that would be great	3
they really reduce unemployment	At this current time, the current context without social housing, with 5 million people on social housing waiting lists, people - of course they should claim housing benefit, if they are unable to pay what are extortionate rents. Particularly in places like London	3
we ask people to do nothing in return for their benefits	It does happen	3
we’ve thought too much, funnily, about the financial incentives to work, and not enough about the conditionality in the system	It’s so unnatural	3
youth unemployment is a blight on our nation	they found that 11% of people who were on benefits said that they felt fully justified being on benefits and have discovered that life without the added complication of work has much to recommend it	3
‘The Daily Telegraph’ pointed out there are 23 people chasing every job in this country	unemployment is a crime not a personal tragedy	3
the welfare state system is creating a whole class of work shy, people who are incentivised not to work	CF is interested in the demoralising impact of welfarism 	3
it is the knock down argument	One is to change the balance of or the generosity of out of work beneifts, maybe spend more on in work benefits like tax credits and so on	3
The official unemployment figure, again Neil has a point on this, is understating the real crisis	there is an internal failure in some cases	3
instead of wasting it lining the pockets of landlords it could be used to build housing which would stimulate the economy, create jobs, bring down the welfare bill, and bring down the social housing waiting lis	I want to live in a London that doesn’t have high levels of homelessness	3
It does happen	we’ve seen millions of people claiming incapacity benefit, being dependent on benefits, young people have a sense of entitlement from the state, rather than a sense of self-reliance	3
It’s so unnatural	That is not the world we live in	3
people are naturally creative and industrious, and want to work	the desire to work is innate	3
that is a not a bad thing	In JB's ‘non-utopia’ where he's abolished the welfare state, xxx is what happens to those 2 million	3
JB didn’t refer to utopia	youth unemployment is a blight on our nation	3
xxx is how JB regards it	a lot of young people sort of, had a sense of entitlement, which wasn't very healthy	3
the welfare state system is creating a whole class of work shy, people who are incentivised not to work	that argument is even stronger if the people you’re relying on are not your friends and family, but other people you don’t even know	3
I might not take back from the National Health Service or from the welfare state, the things that I put in, the money that I put in through my tax	it's not only the right to a job that RS'd accept	3
you get certain ‘social goods’ which are greater than that	I certainly get indirect effects; indirect goods.	3
What is important at this point is that there has to be a serious discussion about the impact of welfarism	JB blames the political system that has created a trap for these people	3
we are living in a country with a minimum wage	It’s so unnatural	3
the point about a welfare state is it was set up as a safety net, during a time of near full employment	the sense of individual self-reliance, and standing on your own two feet and doing everything to avoid taking money from the state has not been chipped away at by the growth of welfarism	3
If you’re going to work very hard for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and you’re going to make only £1 more than you would have made on benefits the urge to get a job is not as strong as it would be if you’d otherwise be penniless	the young guy was smoking a lot of spliff	3
In most other countries there’s something like an unemployment insurance	the Department of Work and Pensions did a survey of people who have been on benefits a couple of years ago	3
JB would want to abolish the welfare state altogether	The reason we have so many people claiming housing benefit is because there isn’t the social housing	3
It’s not beyond the imagination to imagine the young might get up and go and do something about this, other than kind of sit and wait to be handed something.	JB didn’t say “Work shy”	3
We’d still be much better off	In one of the US states that went the furthest in this in diverting people from being on welfare, they managed at one point to reduce the number of people on benefits by 90%	3
they shouldn't resort to petty crime, rather than take benefits	it is ‘scroungers	3
we’ve done a lot to improve work incentives financially	At this current time, the current context without social housing, with 5 million people on social housing waiting lists, people - of course they should claim housing benefit, if they are unable to pay what are extortionate rents. Particularly in places like London	3
it is the knock down argument	it is / is not moral to ask people to work in a job that doesn’t really pay them that much more than being on benefits	3
The official unemployment figure, again Neil has a point on this, is understating the real crisis	the welfare system is the problem	3
James made this very clear – James wasn’t blaming individuals	they are right about that	3
JB's never referred to them being work shy	JB likens it to a mouse trap which has a rather stale piece of cheese in it	3
It creates a dependency on work	that’s part of the way God made people	3
welfarism has become an all consuming be all and end all for a significant minority of society	We kidded ourselves during the last decade that we’d solved the problem of unemployment,	3
Claire has no answer to Neil's complaint that our market in housing has seriously distorted the housing benefit	JB likens it to a mouse trap which has a rather stale piece of cheese in it	3
I might not take back from the National Health Service or from the welfare state, the things that I put in, the money that I put in through my tax	The official unemployment figure, again Neil has a point on this, is understating the real crisis	3
Anne's misunderstood the nature of housing benefit	That’s how JB regards it	3
JB didn’t say “Work shy”	we need to encourage young people to see a third way, an alternative to that	3
it’s moved the furthest away of any of the industrialised countries from a contributory system where what you’ve paid in is what you get out	that’s an ‘Aunt Sally’	3
If it were politically possible, JB would / would not want to abolish the welfare state altogether	instead of wasting it lining the pockets of landlords it could be used to build housing which would stimulate the economy, create jobs, bring down the welfare bill, and bring down the social housing waiting lis	3
JB blames the political system that has created a trap for these people	xxx is what JB will do	3
they’re not naturally lazy	the welfare state should be about what people need/what they deserve	3
I want to live in a London that doesn’t have high levels of homelessness	in itself this is undesirable	3
we’ve done a lot to improve work incentives financially	it is not moral when somebody is saying “I don’t want to move away from being dependent on other people for just any job; only a decent job with a very good wage, or an interesting job.”	3
when it reduces by 90%- what Neil meant is that they were all in low paid, part time jobs	JB would want to abolish the welfare state altogether	3
we’ve had the benefits, whatever they are, from our family of being set up in such a way that we understand the world of working and how to get on in life	many people are working who get it	3
It’s not beyond the imagination to imagine the young might get up and go and do something about this, other than kind of sit and wait to be handed something.	we’ll not further entrench the type of poverty	3
it’s requirement	the young guy’d lost his job at Tesco	3
the welfare state, as it is, is a safety net / is a trap	Nothing JB said implies that JB regards it as a crime	3
people do take those jobs	in itself there is / is not a danger there	3
Claire wants more housing	KM's not in this business	3
RS's kind of treating them as though they’re passive recipients of something	If you look at the wider measure of all the people on benefits: the people on incapacity benefit, the people on income support as well. Actually, even all the way through the years of the debt fuelled boom we had about 5 million people effectively workless	3
JB didn’t say “Work shy”	It’s due to a triple crisis	3
we do need to get back to this idea of desert	Claire has an answer to Neil's complaint that the market in housing has seriously distorted the housing benefit	3
they should really be angry with their government for not addressing the underlying social policy issues	Anne misunderstands how housing benefit works	3
when it reduces by 90%- what Neil meant is that they were all in low paid, part time jobs	we need to think about how to describe the problem, and understand the problem accurately	3
This guy’s just a scrounger, he needs a kick up the backside to get going	xxx is how we move from a policy that we’ve been pursuing for quite a long time, of trying to fight poverty mainly by giving people more in cash benefits, which solves the problem today, to a policy which is more about solving the problem over the long run by moving more people into work, reducing unemployment	3
that would not reduce the amount we spend on housing benefit	we do need to get back to this idea of desert	3
we’ve done a lot to improve work incentives financially	it’s an interesting thought experiment to say that the young could survive on their own, because they’ve got the get up and go, and we should let the witnesses at it, is worth considering	3
that is neither a moral nor a practical way forward	you put a pound in	3
It’s not beyond the imagination to imagine the young might get up and go and do something about this, other than kind of sit and wait to be handed something.	it is not	3
the problem is that welfarism has gone far beyond a safety net, or anything compassionate	that’s what William Beveridge wanted when he was designing the welfare state	3
I want to live in a London that doesn’t have high levels of homelessness	individuals are not  feckless and lazy	3
People have a moral duty to work to support themselves	that majority doesn't include CL	3
There’s no free education	therefore [you are going to provide money to these people	3
JB does not blame the people-	we’ve thought too much, funnily, about the financial incentives to work, and not enough about the conditionality in the system	3
One of the confusing things in Britain is that actually the overwhelming majority of what we call ‘tax credits’, about 30 of the £33bn a year we spend on them is actually spent on stuff that’s actually not at all linked to being in work	these things are in some sort of a balance	3
there is such a lot of evidence that it does have a distorting effect	Claire wants to encourage a society that treats people as grown ups; that allows them to grow up	3
you can’t blame the people who are rationally taking housing benefit when they can’t afford to pay their rent	lots of people are doing part time work	3
it is / is not moral to ask people to work in a job that doesn’t really pay them that much more than being on benefits	the problem is that welfarism has gone far beyond a safety net, or anything compassionate	3
there are too many people included in those categories	It’s due to a triple crisis	3
If you took the people around this table this evening, and you took away all of our contacts, our qualifications our great jobs and so on, we’d still have more internal resources than that guy	that is not a particularly moral position to take	3
people should do xxx in a place like Merthyr Tydfil	the State is subsidising employers who refuse to pay people decent wages	3
JB does not blame the people-	some people have an innate desire, so called, to work harder than others	3
there is very great danger here of stirring up resentment towards people who need welfare to keep house and home together	Claire's argued that we should build over green belt	3
it is not moral when somebody is saying “I don’t want to move away from being dependent on other people for just any job; only a decent job with a very good wage, or an interesting job.”	incentives are irrelevant	3
it clearly shows that Cameron hasn’t learnt any lesson from the past	last year 93% of new claimants were in a household in which somebody worked	3
there’s quite a substantial element of blame of the people who are so called ‘undeserving’, even if Neil doesn't accept the term	this actually has a fine tradition elsewhere	3
There will be a government supplied safety net	Claire wants to encourage a society that treats people as grown ups; that allows them to grow up	3
the State is subsidising employers who refuse to pay people decent wages	these people don't exist	3
I want to live in a London that doesn’t have high levels of homelessness	xxx is how we encourage the young	3
since this government’s come to power they’ve tried to exploit tensions in working class Britain between the working poor and the unemployed; between the non-disabled and the disabled; between private sector workers and public sector workers	Owen is the champion of the working class	3
JB would want to abolish the welfare state altogether	It’s not beyond the imagination to imagine the young might get up and go and do something about this, other than kind of sit and wait to be handed something.	3
that’s not right	it is also very much a trap	3
we need to think about, how we have a more paternalist system for people like that	There’s historically been some resistance from ordinary working class people to actually taking state benefits	3
one of the things that RS picked up when he was listening in the green room was about this idea of this demoralisation	it takes a very simple view	3
we could turn our tax credits, which aren’t really tax credits in the UK, into something you only get paid if you’re working	‘welfare to work’ creates the opposite of a dependency on welfare state	3
you’ve got about 30% of claimants who’ve got some sort of attitudinal problem	we need to think about, how we have a more paternalist system for people like that	3
Anne's misunderstood the nature of housing benefit	we haven’t actually done as much as we could have done	3
AM doesn't quite understand what RS's real criticism is of what Mr Cameron was saying	We have a minimum wage	3
I might not take back from the National Health Service or from the welfare state, the things that I put in, the money that I put in through my tax	the fundamental duty we have as a society towards the unemployed is to make sure there are enough jobs for them to take the opportunity to go and work	3
one of the things that RS picked up when he was listening in the green room was about this idea of this demoralisation	they should really be angry with their government for not addressing the underlying social policy issues	3
people are naturally creative and industrious, and want to work	the welfare state, as it is, is a safety net / is a trap	3
that argument is even stronger if the people you’re relying on are not your friends and family, but other people you don’t even know	in the media there is quite a lot of blame	3
it is not the equivalent of calling people feckless and lazy to say that a lot of young people have become so dependent that they say `Why should I take that job? I don't want to get up that early.''	they don't have a sense of entitlement from the state rather than a sense of self-reliance	3
If one lot of people is going to give another lot of people money, that second lot of people should be willing to work, and should work.	Owen wants to take housing benefit down	3
if you wanted to pay to work and to create a culture of work, it might be useful to have work in the first place, to have proper jobs at proper wages in the first place	it is not	3
the argument that Anne was raising “Let’s not talk about externalities, let’s talk about internalities” as it were, misses the point	CF is interested in the demoralising impact of welfarism 	3
when it reduces by 90%- what Neil meant is that they were all in low paid, part time jobs	In a sense he’s very similar to the abolition of the Board and Lodgings Allowance that Margaret Thatcher brought in at the end of the ‘80s, which obviously saw a huge spike in rough sleeping	3
It does work up to a point insofar that the introduction of tax credits did move some groups, particularly lone parents, that helped to get more of them into employment	What is important at this point is that there has to be a serious discussion about the impact of welfarism	3
they should just get on the bus to Cardiff	The official unemployment figure, again Neil has a point on this, is understating the real crisis	3
the old idea of welfarism as a safety net, has changed	KM didn’t ask JB that	3
we are just providing the work that people want to do	people should do xxx in a place like Merthyr Tydfil	3
That is the real lived experience of ordinary working class people	we should move towards a system which is more based on what you deserve	3
these people don't exist	a lot of young people sort of, had a sense of entitlement, which wasn't very healthy	3
abolishing housing benefit for under 25s will lead to homelessness, hidden homelessness, sofa surfing, staying with the wrong people	There is no natural condition of unemployment	3
that would be great	we are just providing the work that people want to do	3
some people have an innate desire, so called, to work harder than others	what we need is more houses	3
If the market doesn’t, for whatever reason never mind who’s fault it is, then the next thing that the government should do, is to provide jobs for these people to do	Owen has answered Anne's question	3
Clifford had quite an entertaining discussion with James	Claire wants more housing	3
It’s been done to them, not done by them	young people should go out and get something from the world, contribute something to the world. Instead of saying “Why can’t I get a well paid job? Why can’t I get a house?”	3
it is the equivalent of calling people feckless and lazy to say that a lot of young people today have become so dependent in a passive way on somebody else sorting things out for them, that they do say “Why should I take that job? I don’t want to get up that early.”	you got a choice of being mollycoddled at home by your mum and dad, or you demand that you’re sustained by the State	3
There is plenty of evidence to say that there is depression amongst the unemployed.	that’s fair enough	3
JB didn’t refer to utopia	JB likens it to a mouse trap which has a rather stale piece of cheese in it	3
people like KM who believe as a utopia, are precisely the ones who have led to bad policies and bad results.	individuals are feckless and lazy	3
it is true	the fundamental duty we have as a society towards the unemployed is to make sure there are enough jobs for them to take the opportunity to go and work	3
People have a moral duty to work to support themselves	one thing KM may not be aware of is just how much benefits have been cut already by inflation	3
