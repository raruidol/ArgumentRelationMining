Alexander shouldn't be so politically correct	if Melanie's referring to the problem of absent fathers as a source of poverty and deprivation amongst these troubled families, which are really troubling families.

It is about a kind of moral responsibility that the State also has, both to the next generation; to children who grew up in a situation which may set them off on a completely wrong track in life, in which people themselves are often rather miserable and trapped?	what AB and AM’re talking about here is non-domination	0

they’re not able to impose the right sort of levels	it is Helen's view that what we have here is a group of people who can’t impose moral standards on their own lives, and need help to impose those standards on their lives	2
within that bracket Helen would certainly put families who are living with very high levels of aggression and violence, who are terrorising communities	they’re not able to impose the right sort of levels	0

there’s no realistic consideration, or real world consideration	that’s where we can start asking the questions	0
anyone’s saying it should be two, or three, and that’s the limit	that’s where we can start asking the questions	0
they have to look at the interests of the child, and to have a debate about the environment in which you bring children into the world	that is not so morally wrong	1
If you look at these things, as anyone in work would look at, if you can’t afford to have children the State should not step in and say “Unconditionally, we will support you if you make the decision to have children you can’t afford”	they have to look at the interests of the child, and to have a debate about the environment in which you bring children into the world	0
what’s really important is that we try and ask people, say on benefits, to start making the same decisions that we expect the people in work have to make	for the State to start telling people whether or not they should have children, however tempting it might be in any individual case, is a very, very dangerous slippery slope	1
Sometimes people just want to have more children, even if they can’t afford them	That’s a very sort of, cost/benefit analysis approach to social policy and family life	0

They’re both trouble to those within their family, particularly their children, and their and those around them	we do have a moral duty to intervene quite robustly in that situation	0

it seems entirely unclear	Claire is nervous	0
there’s certain people you just say, “You shouldn’t have children, you’re not fit to have children”	There is a kind of weeding out unfit parents	0
People talk about abuse at the same time as talking about getting kids to school on time, at the same time as talking about them not eating the right kind of food and not reading to their kids	it seems entirely unclear	0
That seems to be the danger	Claire doesn't want a State – or Helen, to have a kind of normative view of what good parenting is	0
that is really important	we must get back to who these families are and why they are so  dysfunctional	0
it’s not a role of social workers, or any other person, to say that “You should be capped at number 3.”	as part of that programme, Helen would say that Helen does have a remit to ask parents to consider what having another child would mean for them, and to get them to consider the opportunities for contraception	0

as part of that programme, Helen would say that Helen does have a remit to ask parents to consider what having another child would mean for them, and to get them to consider the opportunities for contraception	a situation in which Helen would tell a woman that she shouldn’t have a child, or another child would be xxx	2

Ruth is not in those cases wholly opposed to family intervention programmes	Ruth would do xxx about it	2
the State has a duty to intervene / it is  wrong to intervene	we’re talking about the general sort of, philosophical underpinning of this.	2
If you take the classic Louise Casey situation: a mother, serially deprived, not been parented herself, can’t look after her child, the child is truanting, the child’s getting into crime, the mother has mental health problems, the mother is abused, non-domination has nothing do with it	a Liberal society has an absolute moral duty to go and help those people, especially the child	0
children can be vulnerable to domination to their parents	the State does have a duty to protect those who are vulnerable to domination	0
There are many different aspects to this,	In MP's long list of ills that are suffered by this family there are some things that would be justifiable grounds and other things that wouldn't be	0
Anne tried to push AB on that	AB talks about neutrality as a principle	0
That’s AB's sort of neutrality	the non judgmental position that the State has taken now for several decades, that lifestyle choice is what it’s all about, we only care about whether the child is poor we don’t care about whether the family is married or not married, and so on. That has actually pushed mass fatherlessness, which has given financial incentives to mass fatherlessness, which has produced untold misery	2
it’s produced terrible harm	it’s not neutrality at all	0
Helen would like social workers to teach people to pay their rent on time, get children to school on time; those kinds of things	Helen would like social workers, the State, to teach people to do xxx	2
this is about getting children into school.	Helen would like social workers to teach people to pay their rent on time, get children to school on time; those kinds of things	0
That would be a baseline, that children are actually safe	this is about getting children into school.	0
you would be intervening	you would accept your non domination theory would fall if you were intervening for the good of those around them as well respecting their rights to be non dominated.	0
It depends on how one unpacks all of those terms.	You would think that you were imposing a kind of domination on your neighbors if you were just behaving very badly, and making everybody’s lives a misery around you	2
Whether it means interfering in those families being able to conduct a flourishing life; whether it’s intervening in their property, in their bodily integrity; in their mental wellbeing by continuous harassment or nuisance.	you would be intervening	0
we already have legislation that can deal with keeping children safe and ensuring they get to school on time	it’s these other areas, these increasing interventions that Claire is interested in	0
they have lost their ability to do that	many of the families they have to teach them how to have fun, and enjoy their children	0
they have lost their ability to do that	they have many more clients that are not as extreme, as the Government would see it	3
that's not a specific example	No parent in the family is in work	3
Claire would be all for reforming the welfare system and education	as Centre for social justice's travelled around the poorest parts of the UK, Centre for social justice's seen consistently there are factors that make it much more likely that you will live in poverty and fail to reach potential you have as a human being	3
Claire is nervous	poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause.	3
one generation’s fortunes are rather dependant on how the generation before them treated them	we have a huge problem with unemployment.	3
that’s sometimes related not being in work	there’s a demand of equal concern that the State has for everyone, such that if these interventions are not working for the most needy cases	3
What seems therefore ridiculous is that in order to solve the problem of over dependency on the State in certain families. What they do is, is they parachute in as the State, and usurps people’s moral autonomy	That’s AB's sort of neutrality	3
problem families are problem families because they cause problems/ they face problems	Alexander shouldn't assume that poverty drives everything	3
what the Government is getting at, is that if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on.	AM felt more strongly against that even than Melanie,	3
we must get back to who these families are and why they are so  dysfunctional	what we had was a whiff of class war, and a lot of moral displacement	3
you would accept your non domination theory would fall if you were intervening for the good of those around them as well respecting their rights to be non dominated.	if you follow this guide then everything will be alright in the world	3
if Ruth keeps going like that, we won’t find any at all	Melanie's talking about the de-incentivisation of marriage, on the basis that we can’t possibly talk about marriage as opposed to un-marriage	3
it is far better, a better form of intervention, to provide decent jobs and decent wages, affordable housing	“Split up, don’t form couples”	3
you would accept your non domination theory would fall if you were intervening for the good of those around them as well respecting their rights to be non dominated.	the State has a duty to intervene / it is  wrong to intervene	3
It can provide jobs, build affordable housing, provide decent leisure facilities, not close down libraries or swimming pools and so on	they need help getting back on track	3
we all know people who will tell you about some terribly wretched childhood that they’ve had	we’re in a position now where there isn’t enough housing, and where actually some of the parents suggest if you’re agoraphobic you can’t go out to pay rent.	3
part of the problem is the distinction people have drawn between the State and society.	What is wrong with what she is doing is that she is presenting that tiny minority of troubled families as typical of the poor	3
MP and RL’re talking here about poor people being moral agents,	we’re rather over inclined - and this is also a moral issue – to focus on the anti social behaviour of the poor, rather than the antisocial behaviour of the rich: the money laundering, the rate fixing, the tax evasion	3
It’s fine to say to people, “You can decide what the good life is”, absolutely; autonomy, fine.	that’s what social services have a responsibility to deal with	3
MP and RL’re talking here about poor people being moral agents,	There are many families, and Louise Casey has this in mind, where for a variety of reasons a lone mother – and it’s usually a lone mother – cannot look after her children properly, doesn’t know how to very often	3
you would accept your non domination theory would fall if you were intervening for the good of those around them as well respecting their rights to be non dominated.	We’ll send the experts in	3
the issue is one of poverty, and resources.	this has somehow changed it to focusing on the individual behaviour	3
Melanie's talking about marriage	And the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items.	3
there’s a demand of equal concern that the State has for everyone, such that if these interventions are not working for the most needy cases	we do have a moral duty to intervene quite robustly in that situation	3
there are many families bringing up children without fathers very well.	if you haven’t had that template then you can’t	3
state intervention only seems to be coercive state intervention in the lives and families of the poor	one generation’s fortunes are rather dependant on how the generation before them treated them	3
Sometimes people just want to have more children, even if they can’t afford them	Alexander shouldn't assume that poverty drives everything	3
The poor don’t lack that any more than the rich.	not from the direction Professor Levitas’s coming from	3
The number of people that fall in the category that the 120,000 comes from, has been falling since 2004	that’s actually coming down as a cohort effect anyway	3
otherwise that’s no use.	what we had was a whiff of class war, and a lot of moral displacement	3
it is Helen's view that what we have here is a group of people who can’t impose moral standards on their own lives, and need help to impose those standards on their lives	we’re rather over inclined - and this is also a moral issue – to focus on the anti social behaviour of the poor, rather than the antisocial behaviour of the rich: the money laundering, the rate fixing, the tax evasion	3
this means nothing	the discourse around this that we’ve had, with some of these very hysterical comments from Louise Casey and the Government, are not acceptable	3
it is because they’re disruptive / because they’re disadvantaged	there is a very tiny minority of families that fall into that situation	3
this is not just saying “Social services should do it”	one generation’s fortunes are rather dependant on how the generation before them treated them	3
Anne tried to push AB on that	So these factors matter.	3
These are children  on the threshold of being taken away to live in care	It’s no excuse	3
there’s parents with mental health problems who have lost their ability to care for their children	that’s a judgment that one might have	3
the way people respond, people’s agency, is inevitably in the context of the lives in which they live	“Split up, don’t form couples”	3
CF doesn’t know	that’s sometimes related not being in work,	3
you can help them get back on their feet and able to parent their children effectively	Claire would be all for reforming the welfare system and education	3
They’re both trouble to those within their family, particularly their children, and their and those around them	they are surely to be presumed to be capable of being helped in a way that allows them to live independent lives.	3
that is what the Government’s trying to get hold of	there is a very tiny minority of families that fall into that situation	3
what she was really talking about is forcing people to adapt to their conditions of poverty, rather than challenging those conditions or creating conditions where moral behaviour could better flourish.	that’s not true.	3
AB does not want to suggest that there’s no role for the State.	the figures are not a moral issue	3
otherwise that’s no use.	Evidence shows that lack of marriage leads to poverty	3
it’s not neutrality at all	the problem that AB has with the State fundamentally that philosophically, that it shouldn’t intervene in the private sphere, in family life, go into people’s homes – which Louise Casey’s proposals would entail / it is that it’s just not very good at it, and therefore it’s just not its role	3
the areas of their life you intervene on, in order to bring about change are xxx	they might find it coercive.	3
if Ruth keeps going like that, we won’t find any at all	we do have a moral duty to intervene quite robustly in that situation	3
the figures are not a moral issue	their particular problems were entirely resultant of the circumstances in which they found themselves	3
If Ruth's not wholly opposed to it, she finds xxx so objectionable that Louise Casey’s offering	what she was really talking about is forcing people to adapt to their conditions of poverty, rather than challenging those conditions or creating conditions where moral behaviour could better flourish.	3
Christian tries to reform individuals within a family context	In MP's long list of ills that are suffered by this family there are some things that would be justifiable grounds and other things that wouldn't be	3
you can see an observable reality, is that families exist who are trouble	they might not find it coercive	3
the figures are a moral issue	It depends on how one unpacks all of those terms.	3
they have lost their ability to do that	we should be very circumspect in the way we intervene in families,	3
It’s no excuse	It’s what Ruth would think if Ruth lived next door	3
in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	these are largely poor areas	3
within that bracket Helen would certainly put families who are living with very high levels of aggression and violence, who are terrorising communities	it doesn’t actually answer the problem;	3
where they are also a problem to those who live around them, it would be a good idea to intervene robustly	It’s actually rather immoral to come up with this kind of structurally derived argument that says, “Your job is really – or our job, collectively – is just to say to people ‘we will not put up with these situations and encourage political action’”.	3
there is a definitional problem here	if you listen both to Government spokespeople and the Prime Minister himself plus a lot of the media, you would think that all of the troubled families that they’re talking about are in a lot of trouble.	3
Ruth would do xxx about it	in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	3
Really horrible things might have happened to them	The other is to say, “Morality is a form of human flourishing, which requires transformation of social conditions.”	3
Ruth quarrelled with the statistics	One is a kind of rule-based morality, which says, “We will impose standards on people, because that’s how they get better.”	3
there are chaotic families that place an unreasonable burden on the State	a situation in which Helen would tell a woman that she shouldn’t have a child, or another child would be xxx	3
AM felt more strongly against that even than Melanie,	you do have to have certain rudiments of knowledge about yourself, about structures, and how you live with other people.	3
to do that, and to present the problem of poverty as one of dysfunctional families who are antisocial and need to have their behaviour changed, is itself a moral issue	if you haven’t had that template then you can’t	3
while we’re bringing the issue of Socialist based arguments in this forum, Alexander would also question the role of market principles in some of the provision of social services here	she was helping them manage their resources.	3
what we need to do to deal with poverty is to deal with problem families	troubled families / troublesome families is / is not the crux of it	3
We’ve had a welfare system now for decades that says, “We will pay you more to be on benefits than to take work.”	You’re kidding CF	3
she is trying to do something about children- the whole scheme is trying to do that	That’s a rather specific example	3
whether you call them problem, or troubled, the question still remains.	CF was trying to cross-examine the first witness, but she actually seemed to be quite concerned about some of the things coming out of the Government	3
One is a kind of rule-based morality, which says, “We will impose standards on people, because that’s how they get better.”	what she was really talking about is forcing people to adapt to their conditions of poverty, rather than challenging those conditions or creating conditions where moral behaviour could better flourish.	3
A kind of parental determinism emerges that’s overly fatalistic as well	Birmingham was given a target of 4180	3
you’ve got to be careful.	the Government seems to be targeting only the poor for intervention	3
we’re talking about the general sort of, philosophical underpinning of this.	There are two different views about State intervention.	3
A kind of parental determinism emerges that’s overly fatalistic as well	Christian tries  to reform individuals	3
the whole of their future is not being blighted, even though it might have been a horrible experience	that really is outrageous	3
the discourse around this that we’ve had, with some of these very hysterical comments from Louise Casey and the Government, are not acceptable	if one is a Liberal, the principal of neutrality is as good as any other.	3
problem families are problem families because they cause problems/ they face problems	Your agency is going to be destroyed that way	3
they’ve overcome them	we’re in a position now where there isn’t enough housing, and where actually some of the parents suggest if you’re agoraphobic you can’t go out to pay rent.	3
If you look at these things, as anyone in work would look at, if you can’t afford to have children the State should not step in and say “Unconditionally, we will support you if you make the decision to have children you can’t afford”	If we want to live in a Liberal society that is also tolerant, we must have a set of principles that we all digest and understand, that ground and explain, and justify why we behave as we do	3
poverty is the cause of multiple disadvantage / poverty is the result of multiple disadvantage	we’ve got ourselves into a complete mess in defining who troubled families are	3
Ruth has an objection to an intervention on the basis of people being poor, as opposed to an intervention on the basis of children genuinely being at risk of neglect or harm	they’ll be the first, often, to admit they need a lot of help.	3
there’s a demand of equal concern that the State has for everyone, such that if these interventions are not working for the most needy cases	as Centre for social justice's travelled around the poorest parts of the UK, Centre for social justice's seen consistently there are factors that make it much more likely that you will live in poverty and fail to reach potential you have as a human being	3
That means not simply looking at the individual, but to change the conditions and provide those sorts of conditions.	If you look at these things, as anyone in work would look at, if you can’t afford to have children the State should not step in and say “Unconditionally, we will support you if you make the decision to have children you can’t afford”	3
the CSJ has for years now looked at social reform across a number of areas	Sometimes people just want to have more children, even if they can’t afford them	3
to concentrate simply on the individual, and his or her response, as opposed to the context of their lives, is immoral.	the initiative is ‘troubled families’, not ‘troublesome families’.	3
families have low income	we already have legislation that can deal with keeping children safe and ensuring they get to school on time	3
they have lost their ability to do that	they have to look at the interests of the child, and to have a debate about the environment in which you bring children into the world	3
if you would like to consider the concept of non domination, freedom as non domination – the non interference on arbitrary grounds in people’s important decisions – then we have to be careful that when we do intervene it’s to increase total non domination. Which would mean not interfering simply because people are mad, sad and bad, but because they are imposing domination on their neighbours	there’s parents with mental health problems who have lost their ability to care for their children	3
it depends on what basis you think they need it, and why	you can get people to effectively adapt to the conditions in which they live	3
There are many families, and Louise Casey has this in mind, where for a variety of reasons a lone mother – and it’s usually a lone mother – cannot look after her children properly, doesn’t know how to very often	that is really important	3
if we’re in a Liberal society, as opposed to a Republican society, we might care about the principal of neutrality;	Helen and Claire should be clear that Helen and Claire’re talking about 120,000 families	3
continuing to intervene, not pausing.	that is not quite in all this	3
that might be breakdown of family, and instability, a welfare system that doesn’t promote work, an education system that doesn’t give you a chance to get a job, debt, alcohol and drugs…	Christian tries to reform individuals within a family context	3
that help should be very carefully calibrated, to restore the capacity for independence and personal responsibility	they are teaching people to manage their poverty, but also to look after their children	3
if you listen both to Government spokespeople and the Prime Minister himself plus a lot of the media, you would think that all of the troubled families that they’re talking about are in a lot of trouble.	one generation’s fortunes are rather dependant on how the generation before them treated them	3
otherwise that’s no use.	they might not find it coercive	3
Helen and Claire should be clear that Helen and Claire’re talking about 120,000 families	AM had a problem with both of the big ‘isms’ in this argument.	3
we’re rather over inclined - and this is also a moral issue – to focus on the anti social behaviour of the poor, rather than the antisocial behaviour of the rich: the money laundering, the rate fixing, the tax evasion	if you would like to consider the concept of non domination, freedom as non domination – the non interference on arbitrary grounds in people’s important decisions – then we have to be careful that when we do intervene it’s to increase total non domination. Which would mean not interfering simply because people are mad, sad and bad, but because they are imposing domination on their neighbours	3
Whether it means interfering in those families being able to conduct a flourishing life; whether it’s intervening in their property, in their bodily integrity; in their mental wellbeing by continuous harassment or nuisance.	morally,Ruth has / has not any objection to this intervention	3
We’ve had a welfare system now for decades that says, “We will pay you more to be on benefits than to take work.”	they’ll show you how to do it	3
they’re not able to impose the right sort of levels	Christian does not realize that it isn’t necessarily coming from a poor background that determines what happens in the future. Or in fact a wonderful loving family, you can end up as some dissipated wreck, alcoholic millionaire kid	3
the State has a duty to intervene / it is  wrong to intervene	there are cases where families are harming themselves and harming others	3
one generation’s fortunes are rather dependant on how the generation before them treated them	Liberal societies have often known that the family can be a nexus for forms of unequal opportunity	3
Melanie's talking about marriage	there is nothing wrong with what she’s doing	3
We mustn't equate poverty with dysfunction	the State has a duty to intervene / it is  wrong to intervene	3
not from the direction Professor Levitas’s coming from	Ruth would do xxx about it	3
part of the problem is the distinction people have drawn between the State and society.	that is not so morally wrong	3
she has been so poorly parented	if you create a structure that says “Make decisions about family structures in a way that you feel benefits you”, but the state gives you a neutral level playing field, that’s a great thing	3
while we’re bringing the issue of Socialist based arguments in this forum, Alexander would also question the role of market principles in some of the provision of social services here	So these factors matter.	3
if one says that poverty is the cause then someone like RL is dooming these people to live in serial disadvantage and pass it down to their children. Which is what RL's side of the argument has done over several decades	There are a lot of criminal activities	3
these families, and the problems they face, have many causes, complicated, springing from social structures, cultural attitudes, all sorts of things	Ruth doesn't like the definition of troubled families, or anything much about all of this	3
that’s the distinction	there’s parents with mental health problems who have lost their ability to care for their children	3
that’s coming down as a cohort effect	there’s a morally sapping character to that	3
they’ve over broadened their remit over recent years	there’s a morally sapping character to that	3
the issue is one of poverty, and resources.	these are largely poor areas	3
This is absurd	they’ll be the first, often, to admit they need a lot of help.	3
there are other families, where actually they do need a great deal of help	Helen and Claire should be clear that Helen and Claire’re talking about 120,000 families	3
her mother was so poorly parented	that's not a specific example	3
Your agency is going to be destroyed that way	they don’t fit certain characteristics, such as for example, serial fatherlessness.	3
they can afford to sort it out themselves	One is a kind of rule-based morality, which says, “We will impose standards on people, because that’s how they get better.”	3
the factors will lead to this	continuing to intervene, not pausing.	3
That’s a very sort of, cost/benefit analysis approach to social policy and family life	what the Government is getting at, is that if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on.	3
One is a kind of rule-based morality, which says, “We will impose standards on people, because that’s how they get better.”	As a result of this Government’s policies there will be more children in that situation	3
in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	within that bracket Helen would certainly put families who are living with very high levels of aggression and violence, who are terrorising communities	3
it’s right to intervene	these are largely poor areas	3
So it’s as if the State imposes on people the notion of the good life, rather than as citizens ourselves we work through what the good life is.	there is a social responsibility for bringing up children appropriately	3
what is the good life? is the question	A kind of parental determinism emerges that’s overly fatalistic as well	3
it doesn’t do something that also has an impact on everyone.	Ruth is not in those cases wholly opposed to family intervention programmes	3
It’s estimated 17% more children will fall into that group by 2015	in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	3
Christian tries  to reform individuals	Claire would be all for reforming the welfare system and education	3
That’s got nothing to do with poverty,	You’ve got no capacity.	3
it’s about creating conditions for them to make their own decisions	the concept of shame, stigma and guilt, and responsibility and shame particularly, is / is not useful in this context	3
we already have legislation that can deal with keeping children safe and ensuring they get to school on time	they cannot cope with the consequences of this progressive and incremental social family breakdown. 	3
what AB and AM’re talking about here is non-domination	They are left absolutely high and dry,	3
You may have more or less of it, the scale may shift, the relativities may shift, but you do have poverty to deal with.	within that bracket Helen would certainly put families who are living with very high levels of aggression and violence, who are terrorising communities	3
if Ruth keeps going like that, we won’t find any at all	these families, and the problems they face, have many causes, complicated, springing from social structures, cultural attitudes, all sorts of things	3
AM had a problem with both of the big ‘isms’ in this argument.	that’s sometimes related not being in work,	3
if one says that poverty is the cause then someone like RL is dooming these people to live in serial disadvantage and pass it down to their children. Which is what RL's side of the argument has done over several decades	that is not quite in all this	3
it wants to get people in those households into school, into work, out of crime. Changing the patterns of, sometimes, a lifetime	what’s really important is that we try and ask people, say on benefits, to start making the same decisions that we expect the people in work have to make	3
there are many poor people who don’t live like this	Claire doesn't want a State – or Helen, to have a kind of normative view of what good parenting is	3
Claire doesn't want a State – or Helen, to have a kind of normative view of what good parenting is	many of the families they have to teach them how to have fun, and enjoy their children	3
all will be well	the figures are not a moral issue	3
The poor don’t lack that any more than the rich.	there are families that are in trouble	3
state intervention only seems to be coercive state intervention in the lives and families of the poor	The other is to say, “Morality is a form of human flourishing, which requires transformation of social conditions.”	3
What seems therefore ridiculous is that in order to solve the problem of over dependency on the State in certain families. What they do is, is they parachute in as the State, and usurps people’s moral autonomy	that’s a judgment that one might have	3
people who grow up in very difficult families don’t run a risk of being difficult themselves	the right to intervene is around well being of children	3
there should be a careful balancing act of freedom.	it depends on what basis you think they need it, and why	3
It’s no excuse	What is wrong with what she is doing is that she is presenting that tiny minority of troubled families as typical of the poor	3
There are many families, and Louise Casey has this in mind, where for a variety of reasons a lone mother – and it’s usually a lone mother – cannot look after her children properly, doesn’t know how to very often	this whole neutrality position is a bit- just a way of getting out of the question.	3
as part of that programme, Helen would say that Helen does have a remit to ask parents to consider what having another child would mean for them, and to get them to consider the opportunities for contraception	that is really important	3
That’s the definition that the Government is using	that is really important	3
the figures are a moral issue	you can see an observable reality, is that families exist who are trouble	3
the factors will lead to this	the big issue here is where the boundary should lie between the family and the State; how much the State should be allowed to, interfere is value laden, intervene.	3
we’re talking about the general sort of, philosophical underpinning of this.	it’s judgemental	3
this is a moral programme	That’s AB's sort of neutrality	3
they will have experienced a drop of 10% overall in their living standards	These are families with a very wide range of needs	3
it is not a numbers game	It’s a social issue, not a moral issue.	3
It’s fine to say to people, “You can decide what the good life is”, absolutely; autonomy, fine.	the concept of shame, stigma and guilt, and responsibility and shame particularly, is / is not useful in this context	3
It depends on how one unpacks all of those terms.	If Ruth's not wholly opposed to it, she finds xxx so objectionable that Louise Casey’s offering	3
there is a definitional problem here	if Ruth keeps going like that, we won’t find any at all	3
there are other families, where actually they do need a great deal of help	it’s not appropriate to use the market here.	3
It’s a social issue, not a moral issue.	When KM asked the first witness about, what was she doing – teaching people to live with poverty, she said “No”	3
what AM's surely ignoring, and what so much of their discussion this evening has ignored, is that there are deserts around our country where there is just serial misery and hopelessness, and despair, and dysfunctionality	the initiative is ‘troubled families’, not ‘troublesome families’.	3
Anne tried to push AB on that	What we need to do to deal with poverty is to do something about the 2 million children who live in poverty	3
what we had was a whiff of class war, and a lot of moral displacement	poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause	3
what this initiative is about doing, is to work with these small numbers of families with very complex needs	their particular problems were entirely resultant of the circumstances in which they found themselves	3
It depends on how one unpacks all of those terms.	there’s certain people you just say, “You shouldn’t have children, you’re not fit to have children”	3
it is Helen's view that what we have here is a group of people who can’t impose moral standards on their own lives, and need help to impose those standards on their lives	MP and RL’re talking here about poor people being moral agents,	3
Christian tries to reform individuals within a family context	that’s not true.	3
the non judgmental position that the State has taken now for several decades, that lifestyle choice is what it’s all about, we only care about whether the child is poor we don’t care about whether the family is married or not married, and so on. That has actually pushed mass fatherlessness, which has given financial incentives to mass fatherlessness, which has produced untold misery	There are two different views about State intervention.	3
continuing to intervene, not pausing.	what’s really important is that we try and ask people, say on benefits, to start making the same decisions that we expect the people in work have to make	3
if you would like to consider the concept of non domination, freedom as non domination – the non interference on arbitrary grounds in people’s important decisions – then we have to be careful that when we do intervene it’s to increase total non domination. Which would mean not interfering simply because people are mad, sad and bad, but because they are imposing domination on their neighbours	there’s a demand of equal concern that the State has for everyone, such that if these interventions are not working for the most needy cases	3
what this initiative is about doing, is to work with these small numbers of families with very complex needs	Sometimes people just want to have more children, even if they can’t afford them	3
we all know people who will tell you about some terribly wretched childhood that they’ve had	if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on	3
there’s certain people you just say, “You shouldn’t have children, you’re not fit to have children”	it is Helen's view that what we have here is a group of people who can’t impose moral standards on their own lives, and need help to impose those standards on their lives	3
This is absurd	There is a kind of weeding out unfit parents	3
if you follow this guide then everything will be alright in the world	they’ll be the first, often, to admit they need a lot of help.	3
they’ve overcome them	one might have moral judgement about the lives these people are living	3
We’ve had a welfare system now for decades that says, “We will pay you more to be on benefits than to take work.”	CF doesn’t know	3
they are not	we will find troubled families	3
In MP's long list of ills that are suffered by this family there are some things that would be justifiable grounds and other things that wouldn't be	Melanie's talking about marriage	3
Claire would be all for reforming the welfare system and education	if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on	3
Christian tries  to reform individuals	terrible harm it’s done	3
we’re talking about the general sort of, philosophical underpinning of this.	there is nothing wrong with what she’s doing	3
there is no analogy between the way a company would use rewards to push forward good employees and not other employees.	if a child’s brought up into a poor family that that’s going to make their life worse?	3
We’ll send the experts in	it is far better, a better form of intervention, to provide decent jobs and decent wages, affordable housing	3
If Melanie's pointing to the phenomena of multiple or clustered disadvantage, if  Alexander were going to name one form of disadvantage as the key determiner it would be poverty, not lack of marriage	That’s AB's sort of neutrality	3
they are surely to be presumed to be capable of being helped in a way that allows them to live independent lives.	So it’s as if the State imposes on people the notion of the good life, rather than as citizens ourselves we work through what the good life is.	3
poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause	the reason why we should care about the poor, is because the poor are really the victims of this	3
the State has a duty to intervene / it is  wrong to intervene	the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items	3
you can help them get back on their feet and able to parent their children effectively	If Melanie's pointing to the phenomena of multiple or clustered disadvantage, if  Alexander were going to name one form of disadvantage as the key determiner it would be poverty, not lack of marriage	3
It can provide jobs, build affordable housing, provide decent leisure facilities, not close down libraries or swimming pools and so on	it seems entirely unclear	3
the factors will lead to this	We’ll send the experts in	3
they need help getting back on track	It’s estimated 17% more children will fall into that group by 2015	3
the concept of shame, stigma and guilt, and responsibility and shame particularly, is / is not useful in this context	It’s estimated 17% more children will fall into that group by 2015	3
it depends on what basis you think they need it, and why	she was helping them manage their resources.	3
poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause.	the Government seems to be targeting only the poor for intervention	3
the non judgmental position that the State has taken now for several decades, that lifestyle choice is what it’s all about, we only care about whether the child is poor we don’t care about whether the family is married or not married, and so on. That has actually pushed mass fatherlessness, which has given financial incentives to mass fatherlessness, which has produced untold misery	if you follow this guide then everything will be alright in the world	3
terrible harm it’s done	they might not find it coercive	3
CG is not taking the first notion of what morality is	we should be very circumspect in the way we intervene in families,	3
MB's been reviewing it.	There are two different views about State intervention.	3
poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause	these families, and the problems they face, have many causes, complicated, springing from social structures, cultural attitudes, all sorts of things	3
There are many different aspects to this,	MB's been reading it too	3
there’s parents with mental health problems who have lost their ability to care for their children	you have to look at personal choices and responsibility, and also the conditions you create around families that lead to those decisions.	3
what the Government is getting at, is that if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on.	that position was non-judgmentalism	3
These things lead to poverty	there’s no realistic consideration, or real world consideration	3
we will find troubled families	There are two different views about State intervention.	3
if Melanie's referring to the problem of absent fathers as a source of poverty and deprivation amongst these troubled families, which are really troubling families. If she's talking about that, then of course there’s issues around the justice of a man’s behavior towards a woman which can raise issues of domination	Helen would go and work in families’ homes, working alongside them to achieve change, and that change would be around improving the circumstances for their children, and making them safe	3
where they are also a problem to those who live around them, it would be a good idea to intervene robustly	Christian tries to reform individuals within a family context	3
That seems to be the danger	the discourse around this that we’ve had, with some of these very hysterical comments from Louise Casey and the Government, are not acceptable	3
Christian tries to reform families, not individuals	if the State actually says that you are incapable of acting out on your lives, without us teaching you, treating you like children – in loco parentis, for the parents in this instance. Then obviously, xxx is what happens to free will then. xxx is what happens to your capacity to act on the world	3
A kind of parental determinism emerges that’s overly fatalistic as well	if you look at the figures, fatherlessness, family breakdown, is disproportionately represented in all these social problems. 	3
there is a very important moral issue here,	a number of these families exist who do cause problems to the children who grow up in them, and the people around them.	3
for the State to start telling people whether or not they should have children, however tempting it might be in any individual case, is a very, very dangerous slippery slope	all will be well	3
it’s not appropriate to use the market here.	as Centre for social justice's travelled around the poorest parts of the UK, Centre for social justice's seen consistently there are factors that make it much more likely that you will live in poverty and fail to reach potential you have as a human being	3
It’s created a lot of victims who now need help themselves, and who sometimes go on to create other victims through crime	That’s the definition that the Government is using	3
Claire doesn't want a State – or Helen, to have a kind of normative view of what good parenting is	the areas of their life you intervene on, in order to bring about change are xxx	3
That would be a baseline, that children are actually safe	CG's taking the first notion of what morality is	3
we’ve got ourselves into a complete mess in defining who troubled families are	Christian tries to reform families, not individuals	3
that is the moral way of getting people to pay their rent on time	they have many more clients that are not as extreme, as the Government would see it	3
It’s fine to say to people, “You can decide what the good life is”, absolutely; autonomy, fine.	we’re rather over inclined - and this is also a moral issue – to focus on the anti social behaviour of the poor, rather than the antisocial behaviour of the rich: the money laundering, the rate fixing, the tax evasion	3
Helen would like social workers, the State, to teach people to do xxx	the Government seems to be targeting only the poor for intervention	3
AM shouldn't go all ‘Fifty Shades of Grey'	it’s produced terrible harm	3
AM had a problem with both of the big ‘isms’ in this argument.	she is trying to do something about children- the whole scheme is trying to do that	3
they cannot cope with the consequences of this progressive and incremental social family breakdown. 	continuing to intervene, not pausing.	3
it wants to get people in those households into school, into work, out of crime. Changing the patterns of, sometimes, a lifetime	There are many families, and Louise Casey has this in mind, where for a variety of reasons a lone mother – and it’s usually a lone mother – cannot look after her children properly, doesn’t know how to very often	3
problem families are problem families because they cause problems/ they face problems	it seems entirely unclear	3
Family lives in overcrowded housing	the Government seems to be targeting only the poor for intervention	3
families have low income	the first witness made some very interesting points	3
The State can never really be neutral though,	there’s a huge amount of evidence, research, academic anecdotal that says certain factors make it much more likely that you will not exit poverty, or you won’t prevent poverty. Poverty being more than income, by the way	3
the discourse around this that we’ve had, with some of these very hysterical comments from Louise Casey and the Government, are not acceptable	So it’s as if the State imposes on people the notion of the good life, rather than as citizens ourselves we work through what the good life is.	3
families have low income	We mustn't equate poverty with dysfunction	3
The number of people that fall in the category that the 120,000 comes from, has been falling since 2004	they have many more clients that are not as extreme, as the Government would see it	3
Ruth has an objection to an intervention on the basis of people being poor, as opposed to an intervention on the basis of children genuinely being at risk of neglect or harm	This is absurd	3
what the Government is getting at, is that if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on.	to concentrate simply on the individual, and his or her response, as opposed to the context of their lives, is immoral.	3
That’s AB's sort of neutrality	the discourse around this that we’ve had, with some of these very hysterical comments from Louise Casey and the Government, are not acceptable	3
Ruth doesn't like the definition of troubled families, or anything much about all of this	that is really quite  in al this	3
if we’re in a Liberal society, as opposed to a Republican society, we might care about the principal of neutrality;	morally,Ruth has / has not any objection to this intervention	3
It’s very difficult to parent well in those circumstances.	and it’s fundamentally immoral	3
what is the good life? is the question	they’ve over broadened their remit over recent years	3
that might be breakdown of family, and instability, a welfare system that doesn’t promote work, an education system that doesn’t give you a chance to get a job, debt, alcohol and drugs…	We’re offering things on a rewards based process, which is if the local government succeeds in achieving its results then it gets more money. If it doesn’t, it won’t.	3
the right to intervene is around well being of children	whether you call them problem, or troubled, the question still remains.	3
AB talks about neutrality as a principle	The State can never really be neutral though,	3
to do that, and to present the problem of poverty as one of dysfunctional families who are antisocial and need to have their behaviour changed, is itself a moral issue	what the Government is getting at, is that if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on.	3
AB does not want to suggest that there’s no role for the State.	These are families with a very wide range of needs	3
the issue is not one of poverty and resources	We’ll send the experts in	3
that’s not true.	the State has taken a moral position	3
It’s what Ruth would think if Ruth lived next door	they are on the edges or actually committing crime	3
MP and RL’re talking here about poor people being moral agents,	there are families with problems	3
we have a huge problem with unemployment.	there are families that are so troubled that family intervention programmes are appropriate.	3
There are a lot of criminal activities	part of the problem is the distinction people have drawn between the State and society.	3
Ruth quarrelled with the statistics	the non judgmental position that the State has taken now for several decades, that lifestyle choice is what it’s all about, we only care about whether the child is poor we don’t care about whether the family is married or not married, and so on. That has actually pushed mass fatherlessness, which has given financial incentives to mass fatherlessness, which has produced untold misery	3
it’s the former	AM shouldn't go all ‘Fifty Shades of Grey'	3
morally,Ruth has / has not any objection to this intervention	So these factors matter.	3
if a child’s brought up into a poor family that that’s going to make their life worse?	it doesn’t do something that also has an impact on everyone.	3
you have to look at personal choices and responsibility, and also the conditions you create around families that lead to those decisions.	It can provide jobs, build affordable housing, provide decent leisure facilities, not close down libraries or swimming pools and so on	3
what is happening is that this is a small number of social work clients, 120,000	These things lead to poverty	3
what she was really talking about is forcing people to adapt to their conditions of poverty, rather than challenging those conditions or creating conditions where moral behaviour could better flourish.	that is not quite in all this	3
you can help them get back on their feet and able to parent their children effectively	they’ll show you how to do it	3
people who grow up in very difficult families don’t run a risk of being difficult themselves	There are a lot of criminal activities	3
this is about compassion, social justice, giving these families a chance and no longer writing them off and leaving them on a social scrapheap.	Alexander shouldn't be so politically correct	3
CG's taking the first notion of what morality is	There are a lot of criminal activities	3
we do have a moral duty to intervene quite robustly in that situation	if Melanie's referring to the problem of absent fathers as a source of poverty and deprivation amongst these troubled families, which are really troubling families. If she's talking about that, then of course there’s issues around the justice of a man’s behavior towards a woman which can raise issues of domination	3
this is about compassion, social justice, giving these families a chance and no longer writing them off and leaving them on a social scrapheap.	AB does not want to suggest that there’s no role for the State.	3
that’s not true.	a Liberal society has an absolute moral duty to go and help those people, especially the child	3
there’s no realistic consideration, or real world consideration	they are on the edges or actually committing crime	3
One is a kind of rule-based morality, which says, “We will impose standards on people, because that’s how they get better.”	there’s a demand of equal concern that the State has for everyone, such that if these interventions are not working for the most needy cases	3
it is because they’re disruptive / because they’re disadvantaged	they’re not able to impose the right sort of levels	3
Helen and Claire should be clear that Helen and Claire’re talking about 120,000 families	a Liberal society has an absolute moral duty to go and help those people, especially the child	3
The other is to say, “Morality is a form of human flourishing, which requires transformation of social conditions.”	poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause	3
they need help getting back on track	they might not find it coercive	3
that’s the distinction	the Government is / is not right in its definition of the problem	3
it is / is not right in its strategy for tackling it	the debate about whether the State stepping in telling people to have children or not, is not the debate tonight	3
the whole of their future is not being blighted, even though it might have been a horrible experience	you can help them get back on their feet and able to parent their children effectively	3
Then that leads to poverty, and not to mention family breakdown	the Government is deliberately using a figure which is about multiple deprivation	3
the issue is one of poverty, and resources.	you can see an observable reality, is that families exist who are trouble	3
AM had a problem with both of the big ‘isms’ in this argument.	If Melanie's pointing to the phenomena of multiple or clustered disadvantage, if  Alexander were going to name one form of disadvantage as the key determiner it would be poverty, not lack of marriage	3
we’ve got ourselves into a complete mess in defining who troubled families are	AM felt more strongly against that even than Melanie,	3
Helen is teaching people to live with their poverty, effectively	MB's been reading it too	3
there’s two ways we can look at this	If you look at these things, as anyone in work would look at, if you can’t afford to have children the State should not step in and say “Unconditionally, we will support you if you make the decision to have children you can’t afford”	3
the areas of their life you intervene on, in order to bring about change are xxx	That surely is the challenge	3
what the Government is getting at, is that if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on.	the issue is one of poverty, and resources.	3
the idea of ‘the’ problem family is a useful invention that’s been used again and again to police the poor, and to place the blame for social problems on individuals	it is not a numbers game	3
this is about getting children into school.	you’ve got to be careful.	3
we have a huge problem with unemployment.	that’s coming down as a cohort effect	3
the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items	People talk about abuse at the same time as talking about getting kids to school on time, at the same time as talking about them not eating the right kind of food and not reading to their kids	3
it’s the former	CF hasn’t tried it yet,	3
they’ve overcome them	they’ll show you how to do it	3
This idea that you know, if your mother didn’t love you or you had a terrible background – sometimes the children, the daughters of those families become the most wonderful, careful mothers precisely as a reaction.	there are many poor people who don’t live like this	3
my income is likely to drop	that’s the decider	3
what we had was a whiff of class war, and a lot of moral displacement	it doesn’t actually answer the problem;	3
That’s a very sort of, cost/benefit analysis approach to social policy and family life	MP and RL’re talking here about poor people being moral agents,	3
these families, and the problems they face, have many causes, complicated, springing from social structures, cultural attitudes, all sorts of things	what she was really talking about is forcing people to adapt to their conditions of poverty, rather than challenging those conditions or creating conditions where moral behaviour could better flourish.	3
the conditions under which people live aren’t conducive to moral flourishing, and therefore what you want to do is challenge those conditions, change them	that’s a judgment that one might have	3
whether you call them problem, or troubled, the question still remains.	poverty is the cause of multiple disadvantage/ poverty is the result of multiple disadvantage	3
The State can never really be neutral though,	it is Helen's view that what we have here is a group of people who can’t impose moral standards on their own lives, and need help to impose those standards on their lives	3
there is a very important moral issue here,	There are two different views about State intervention.	3
AM felt more strongly against that even than Melanie,	we’ve got a set of good practice parents, good practice child rearing,	3
Anne tried to push AB on that	Melanie's talking about marriage	3
they’ve overcome them	if a child's brought up into a poor family that's not going to make the family's life worse	3
there is a very important moral issue here,	they can afford to sort it out themselves	3
that’s what social services have a responsibility to deal with	it’s the former	3
This idea that you know, if your mother didn’t love you or you had a terrible background – sometimes the children, the daughters of those families become the most wonderful, careful mothers precisely as a reaction.	CF hasn’t tried it yet,	3
that’s not true.	there are many forms of state intervention	3
for the State to start telling people whether or not they should have children, however tempting it might be in any individual case, is a very, very dangerous slippery slope	That means not simply looking at the individual, but to change the conditions and provide those sorts of conditions.	3
No parent in the family is in work	what this initiative is about doing, is to work with these small numbers of families with very complex needs	3
CG is not taking the first notion of what morality is	anyone’s saying it should be two, or three, and that’s the limit	3
if you listen both to Government spokespeople and the Prime Minister himself plus a lot of the media, you would think that all of the troubled families that they’re talking about are in a lot of trouble.	there are two fundamentally different moral approaches to this problem.	3
the State has taken a moral position	as part of that programme, Helen would say that Helen does have a remit to ask parents to consider what having another child would mean for them, and to get them to consider the opportunities for contraception	3
there are chaotic families that place an unreasonable burden on the State	AB talks about neutrality as a principle	3
she didn’t want any focus where it really counts for an awful lot of people, which is what’s going on around them.	that’s what social services have a responsibility to deal with	3
the debate about whether the State stepping in telling people to have children or not, is not the debate tonight	Really horrible things might have happened to them	3
That surely, more than anything else, has driven the phenomenon in which thousands and thousands of children are being brought up in elective fatherless families, and are going potty as a result.	The State can never really be neutral though,	3
there are 5 million people on the waiting list for social housing	AB does not want to suggest that there’s no role for the State.	3
we have a huge problem with unemployment.	There is a kind of weeding out unfit parents	3
they’ll be the first, often, to admit they need a lot of help.	it wants to get people in those households into school, into work, out of crime. Changing the patterns of, sometimes, a lifetime	3
People talk about abuse at the same time as talking about getting kids to school on time, at the same time as talking about them not eating the right kind of food and not reading to their kids	CF hasn’t tried it yet,	3
what this initiative is about doing, is to work with these small numbers of families with very complex needs	it’s produced terrible harm	3
we’re talking here about families with children	within that bracket Helen would certainly put families who are living with very high levels of aggression and violence, who are terrorising communities	3
that's not a specific example	CF was trying to cross-examine the first witness, but she actually seemed to be quite concerned about some of the things coming out of the Government	3
Your agency is going to be destroyed that way	my income is likely to drop	3
That’s got nothing to do with poverty,	KM said nothing of the sort	3
you do have to have certain rudiments of knowledge about yourself, about structures, and how you live with other people.	if you create a structure that says “Make decisions about family structures in a way that you feel benefits you”, but the state gives you a neutral level playing field, that’s a great thing	3
there’s a danger here that Christian basically cannot see a possibility of breaking this, or people breaking it themselves	the State does have a duty to protect those who are vulnerable to domination	3
This is absurd	the problem of social justice is these 120,000 families	3
they need help getting back on track	poverty is the cause of multiple disadvantage / poverty is the result of multiple disadvantage	3
that’s where we can start asking the questions	So it’s as if the State imposes on people the notion of the good life, rather than as citizens ourselves we work through what the good life is.	3
there’s certain people you just say, “You shouldn’t have children, you’re not fit to have children”	Alexander shouldn't assume that poverty drives everything	3
Evidence shows that lack of marriage leads to poverty	there is no analogy between the way a company would use rewards to push forward good employees and not other employees.	3
it is / is not right in its strategy for tackling it	the Government is / is not right in its definition of the problem	3
AB does not want to suggest that there’s no role for the State.	that’s what’s trying to be addressed here.	3
Melanie's talking about marriage	Evidence shows that lack of marriage leads to poverty	3
There is a kind of weeding out unfit parents	what is the good life? is the question	3
And the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items.	she was helping them manage their resources.	3
if we’re in a Liberal society, as opposed to a Republican society, we might care about the principal of neutrality;	It’s a social issue, not a moral issue.	3
And the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items.	they need help getting back on track	3
that’s what social services have a responsibility to deal with	the non judgmental position that the State has taken now for several decades, that lifestyle choice is what it’s all about, we only care about whether the child is poor we don’t care about whether the family is married or not married, and so on. That has actually pushed mass fatherlessness, which has given financial incentives to mass fatherlessness, which has produced untold misery	3
And the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items.	a number of these families exist who do cause problems to the children who grow up in them, and the people around them.	3
AM had a problem with both of the big ‘isms’ in this argument.	the Government is deliberately using a figure which is about multiple deprivation	3
that’s sometimes related not being in work,	they are teaching people to manage their poverty, but also to look after their children	3
they actually want help,	the idea of ‘the’ problem family is a useful invention that’s been used again and again to police the poor, and to place the blame for social problems on individuals	3
problem families are problem families because they cause problems/ they face problems	part of the problem is the distinction people have drawn between the State and society.	3
in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	they have to look at the interests of the child, and to have a debate about the environment in which you bring children into the world	3
That would be a baseline, that children are actually safe	They’ve basically not been fated by that	3
the non judgmental position that the State has taken now for several decades, that lifestyle choice is what it’s all about, we only care about whether the child is poor we don’t care about whether the family is married or not married, and so on. That has actually pushed mass fatherlessness, which has given financial incentives to mass fatherlessness, which has produced untold misery	the problem of family breakdown started with middle class people, like Professor’s of Sociology quite frankly.	3
The State can provide information, guidance, and assistance on a voluntary basis.	there’s a huge amount of evidence, research, academic anecdotal that says certain factors make it much more likely that you will not exit poverty, or you won’t prevent poverty. Poverty being more than income, by the way	3
it depends on what basis you think they need it, and why	poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause	3
she has been so poorly parented	it is not a numbers game	3
From the last witness, Alexander Brown, we heard the limits of ultra Libertarianism,	if you haven’t had that template then you can’t	3
From the last witness, Alexander Brown, we heard the limits of ultra Libertarianism,	if you create a structure that says “Make decisions about family structures in a way that you feel benefits you”, but the state gives you a neutral level playing field, that’s a great thing	3
many of the families they have to teach them how to have fun, and enjoy their children	poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause	3
the reason why we should care about the poor, is because the poor are really the victims of this	what we need to do to deal with poverty is to deal with problem families	3
evidence shows that those who are in poverty are more likely to be facing all of these other forms of disadvantage	it depends on what basis you think they need it, and why	3
That surely, more than anything else, has driven the phenomenon in which thousands and thousands of children are being brought up in elective fatherless families, and are going potty as a result.	one generation’s fortunes are rather dependant on how the generation before them treated them	3
It’s not coercive at all	My concern is  that we now see people as though they’re going to replicate and reproduce.	3
These things lead to poverty	if one says that poverty is the cause then someone like RL is dooming these people to live in serial disadvantage and pass it down to their children. Which is what RL's side of the argument has done over several decades	3
it is / is not right in its strategy for tackling it	a Liberal society has an absolute moral duty to go and help those people, especially the child	3
the CSJ has for years now looked at social reform across a number of areas	there’s a danger here that Christian basically cannot see a possibility of breaking this, or people breaking it themselves	3
as part of that programme, Helen would say that Helen does have a remit to ask parents to consider what having another child would mean for them, and to get them to consider the opportunities for contraception	this whole neutrality position is a bit- just a way of getting out of the question.	3
you would accept your non domination theory would fall if you were intervening for the good of those around them as well respecting their rights to be non dominated.	if you create a structure that says “Make decisions about family structures in a way that you feel benefits you”, but the state gives you a neutral level playing field, that’s a great thing	3
they have lost their ability to do that	The State can provide information, guidance, and assistance on a voluntary basis.	3
the problem that AB has with the State fundamentally that philosophically, that it shouldn’t intervene in the private sphere, in family life, go into people’s homes – which Louise Casey’s proposals would entail / it is that it’s just not very good at it, and therefore it’s just not its role	this is about compassion, social justice, giving these families a chance and no longer writing them off and leaving them on a social scrapheap.	3
we have a huge problem with unemployment.	children can be vulnerable to domination to their parents	3
if you look at the figures, fatherlessness, family breakdown, is disproportionately represented in all these social problems. 	part of the problem is the distinction people have drawn between the State and society.	3
there are 5 million people on the waiting list for social housing	there’s a risk.	3
People have survived that for centuries	Then that leads to poverty, and not to mention family breakdown.	3
one might have moral judgement about the lives these people are living	the poor are in the most disadvantaged of all positions.	3
we have a huge problem with unemployment	there’s a danger here that Christian basically cannot see a possibility of breaking this, or people breaking it themselves	3
the CSJ has for years now looked at social reform across a number of areas	there is a social responsibility for bringing up children appropriately	3
we must get back to who these families are and why they are so  dysfunctional	People have survived that for centuries	3
Helen is teaching people to live with their poverty, effectively	the problem that AB has with the State fundamentally that philosophically, that it shouldn’t intervene in the private sphere, in family life, go into people’s homes – which Louise Casey’s proposals would entail / it is that it’s just not very good at it, and therefore it’s just not its role	3
there’s parents with mental health problems who have lost their ability to care for their children	That’s a very sort of, cost/benefit analysis approach to social policy and family life	3
it’s right to tackle the problem of troubled families	the State does have a duty to protect those who are vulnerable to domination	3
this figure of 120,000 which has already been floated several times in this discussion, is entirely spurious	the Government is / is not right in its definition of the problem	3
Helen is teaching people to live with their poverty, effectively	It’s what Ruth would think if Ruth lived next door	3
it’s produced terrible harm	there are families that are in trouble	3
Christian tries  to reform individuals	they will have experienced a drop of 10% overall in their living standards	3
The State can provide information, guidance, and assistance on a voluntary basis.	the idea of ‘the’ problem family is a useful invention that’s been used again and again to police the poor, and to place the blame for social problems on individuals	3
if one says that poverty is the cause then someone like RL is dooming these people to live in serial disadvantage and pass it down to their children. Which is what RL's side of the argument has done over several decades	continuing to intervene, not pausing.	3
It depends on how one unpacks all of those terms.	that it’s not the job of Government to favour or privilege any one moral view.	3
many of the families they have to teach them how to have fun, and enjoy their children	what is the good life? is the question	3
if Ruth keeps going like that, we won’t find any at all	That means not simply looking at the individual, but to change the conditions and provide those sorts of conditions.	3
that’s dangerous	Anne tried to push AB on that	3
Ruth wanted to have some people made guilty for falling short	there are families that are in trouble	3
In Hammersmith, Fulham, Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster, which is a tri-borough consortium, they were given the target of 1720 families out of the 120,000	Helen and Claire should be clear that Helen and Claire’re talking about 120,000 families	3
It’s what Ruth would think if Ruth lived next door	if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on	3
Helen is teaching people to live with their poverty, effectively	this whole neutrality position is a bit- just a way of getting out of the question.	3
she is trying to do something about children- the whole scheme is trying to do that	Then that leads to poverty, and not to mention family breakdown	3
the household has a low income	the factors will lead to this	3
Claire is nervous	One is a kind of rule-based morality, which says, “We will impose standards on people, because that’s how they get better.”	3
So these factors matter.	there are two fundamentally different moral approaches to this problem.	3
There’s an upfront, and later.	this is not just saying “Social services should do it”	3
they might not find it coercive	that’s where we can start asking the questions	3
There is a kind of weeding out unfit parents	the areas of their life you intervene on, in order to bring about change are xxx	3
you would accept your non domination theory would fall if you were intervening for the good of those around them as well respecting their rights to be non dominated.	Family lives in overcrowded housing	3
CG is not taking the first notion of what morality is	the issue is one of poverty, and resources.	3
the State does have a duty to protect those who are vulnerable to domination	Melanie's talking about the de-incentivisation of marriage, on the basis that we can’t possibly talk about marriage as opposed to un-marriage	3
if one says that poverty is the cause then someone like RL is dooming these people to live in serial disadvantage and pass it down to their children. Which is what RL's side of the argument has done over several decades	It can be both	3
what is the good life? is the question	the whole of their future is not being blighted, even though it might have been a horrible experience	3
that’s coming down as a cohort effect	The other is to say, “Morality is a form of human flourishing, which requires transformation of social conditions.”	3
they respond well to the framework in which you give them that help.	they need help getting back on track	3
That surely is the challenge	It’s fine to say to people, “You can decide what the good life is”, absolutely; autonomy, fine.	3
you do have to have certain rudiments of knowledge about yourself, about structures, and how you live with other people.	there are factors around these families that mean that they have been let down by Government, by structures, by systems – say the welfare system.	3
it’s much more likely	while we’re bringing the issue of Socialist based arguments in this forum, Alexander would also question the role of market principles in some of the provision of social services here	3
xxx is the template the Government is seeking to replicate	as part of that programme, Helen would say that Helen does have a remit to ask parents to consider what having another child would mean for them, and to get them to consider the opportunities for contraception	3
Anne tried to push AB on that	And the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items.	3
the discourse around this that we’ve had, with some of these very hysterical comments from Louise Casey and the Government, are not acceptable	When KM asked the first witness about, what was she doing – teaching people to live with poverty, she said “No”	3
Liberal societies have often known that the family can be a nexus for forms of unequal opportunity	it doesn’t actually answer the problem;	3
Then that leads to poverty, and not to mention family breakdown	evidence shows that those who are in poverty are more likely to be facing all of these other forms of disadvantage	3
Your agency is going to be destroyed that way	there’s a demand of equal concern that the State has for everyone, such that if these interventions are not working for the most needy cases	3
xxx is the template the Government is seeking to replicate	in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	3
and it’s fundamentally immoral	One is a kind of rule-based morality, which says, “We will impose standards on people, because that’s how they get better.”	3
if Melanie's referring to the problem of absent fathers as a source of poverty and deprivation amongst these troubled families, which are really troubling families. If she's talking about that, then of course there’s issues around the justice of a man’s behavior towards a woman which can raise issues of domination	We’ll send the experts in	3
they’ve never had it	that’s a judgment that one might have	3
Helen would go and work in families’ homes, working alongside them to achieve change, and that change would be around improving the circumstances for their children, and making them safe	This is absurd	3
they respond well to the framework in which you give them that help.	the CSJ has for years now looked at social reform across a number of areas	3
If you take the classic Louise Casey situation: a mother, serially deprived, not been parented herself, can’t look after her child, the child is truanting, the child’s getting into crime, the mother has mental health problems, the mother is abused, non-domination has nothing do with it	that’s sometimes related not being in work,	3
families have low income	there are high levels of concern over their ability to care for their children	3
It can provide jobs, build affordable housing, provide decent leisure facilities, not close down libraries or swimming pools and so on	the big issue here is where the boundary should lie between the family and the State; how much the State should be allowed to, interfere is value laden, intervene.	3
Sometimes people just want to have more children, even if they can’t afford them	Whether it means interfering in those families being able to conduct a flourishing life; whether it’s intervening in their property, in their bodily integrity; in their mental wellbeing by continuous harassment or nuisance.	3
otherwise that’s no use.	Your agency is going to be destroyed that way	3
There are many different aspects to this,	That’s AB's sort of neutrality	3
anyone’s saying it should be two, or three, and that’s the limit	the State has taken a moral position	3
if you look at the figures, fatherlessness, family breakdown, is disproportionately represented in all these social problems. 	We’ve had a welfare system now for decades that says, “We will pay you more to be on benefits than to take work.”	3
if the State actually says that you are incapable of acting out on your lives, without us teaching you, treating you like children – in loco parentis, for the parents in this instance. Then obviously, xxx is what happens to free will then. xxx is what happens to your capacity to act on the world	There are a lot of criminal activities	3
they’ve overcome them	This is just crude Marxism	3
the State has a duty to intervene / it is  wrong to intervene	The other is to say, “Morality is a form of human flourishing, which requires transformation of social conditions.”	3
It’s actually rather immoral to come up with this kind of structurally derived argument that says, “Your job is really – or our job, collectively – is just to say to people ‘we will not put up with these situations and encourage political action’”.	Anne and Ruth agree that there are some troubled families	3
there’s some political rhetoric flying around that CG would not choose to be using.	poverty is the cause of multiple disadvantage/ poverty is the result of multiple disadvantage	3
It’s created a lot of victims who now need help themselves, and who sometimes go on to create other victims through crime	the State does have a duty to protect those who are vulnerable to domination	3
it’s not a role of social workers, or any other person, to say that “You should be capped at number 3.”	we’ve got ourselves into a complete mess in defining who troubled families are	3
KM said nothing of the sort	That surely, more than anything else, has driven the phenomenon in which thousands and thousands of children are being brought up in elective fatherless families, and are going potty as a result.	3
The State can provide information, guidance, and assistance on a voluntary basis.	That’s a rather specific example	3
there are high levels of concern over their ability to care for their children	if I have a child, I have to consider if I can afford the child	3
this means nothing	they are on the edges or actually committing crime	3
Birmingham was given a target of 4180	It’s very difficult to parent well in those circumstances.	3
Christian tries to reform individuals within a family context	the reason why we should care about the poor, is because the poor are really the victims of this	3
that’s a judgment that one might have	CG is not taking the first notion of what morality is	3
the way people respond, people’s agency, is inevitably in the context of the lives in which they live	poverty is the cause of multiple disadvantage/ poverty is the result of multiple disadvantage	3
Alexander shouldn't assume that poverty drives everything	poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause	3
it’s produced terrible harm	while we’re bringing the issue of Socialist based arguments in this forum, Alexander would also question the role of market principles in some of the provision of social services here	3
There are a lot of criminal activities	You’re just basically told you’re not up to it.	3
that it’s not the job of Government to favour or privilege any one moral view.	this is a moral programme	3
there are other families, where actually they do need a great deal of help	they’ll show you how to do it	3
They’ve basically not been fated by that	it’s produced terrible harm	3
MB's been reviewing it.	it’s much more likely	3
Melanie doesn’t want to get bogged down into a discussion about a figure	Melanie's talking about the de-incentivisation of marriage, on the basis that we can’t possibly talk about marriage as opposed to un-marriage	3
these families, and the problems they face, have many causes, complicated, springing from social structures, cultural attitudes, all sorts of things	they are teaching people to manage their poverty, but also to look after their children	3
if Melanie's referring to the problem of absent fathers as a source of poverty and deprivation amongst these troubled families, which are really troubling families. If she's talking about that, then of course there’s issues around the justice of a man’s behavior towards a woman which can raise issues of domination	you would accept your non domination theory would fall if you were intervening for the good of those around them as well respecting their rights to be non dominated.	3
many of the families they have to teach them how to have fun, and enjoy their children	The third category would be the families who really have just lost their ability to parent for their children	3
they have many more clients that are not as extreme, as the Government would see it	it’s right to intervene	3
problem families are problem families because they cause problems/ they face problems	this means nothing	3
There are two different views about State intervention.	The State can provide information, guidance, and assistance on a voluntary basis.	3
as part of that programme, Helen would say that Helen does have a remit to ask parents to consider what having another child would mean for them, and to get them to consider the opportunities for contraception	there is a definitional problem here	3
Claire doesn't want a State – or Helen, to have a kind of normative view of what good parenting is	there are two other brackets that I would bring within the troubled family scenario	3
the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items	the discourse around this that we’ve had, with some of these very hysterical comments from Louise Casey and the Government, are not acceptable	3
they have many more clients that are not as extreme, as the Government would see it	In Hammersmith, Fulham, Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster, which is a tri-borough consortium, they were given the target of 1720 families out of the 120,000	3
It’s a social issue, not a moral issue.	they’ll show you how to do it	3
MP and RL’re talking here about poor people being moral agents,	AB does not want to suggest that there’s no role for the State.	3
There’s a risk that they can be brought up into wonderful families and turn into monsters.	The thing that is most frustrating is that, and in fact a number of witnesses worried about over dependence on the State.	3
We’ve had a welfare system now for decades that says, “We will pay you more to be on benefits than to take work.”	there are families that are in trouble	3
that is the moral way of getting people to pay their rent on time	we have to look at these families as families that need a lot of help,	3
poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause.	that is not quite in all this	3
if you would like to consider the concept of non domination, freedom as non domination – the non interference on arbitrary grounds in people’s important decisions – then we have to be careful that when we do intervene it’s to increase total non domination. Which would mean not interfering simply because people are mad, sad and bad, but because they are imposing domination on their neighbours	Melanie's talking about marriage	3
if we’re in a Liberal society, as opposed to a Republican society, we might care about the principal of neutrality;	you do have to have certain rudiments of knowledge about yourself, about structures, and how you live with other people.	3
You would think that you were imposing a kind of domination on your neighbors if you were just behaving very badly, and making everybody’s lives a misery around you	the Government seems to be targeting only the poor for intervention	3
It should try to be as neutral as possible between those, except in cases such that people’s chosen morality prevents other people from living their lives.	you can get people to effectively adapt to the conditions in which they live	3
That surely is the challenge	it can if they can get it to the people who need it	3
because of his fetish about non- domination there was very little in which he would ever intervene	That’s the definition that the Government is using	3
poverty is the driver of events	the household has a low income	3
It is not a family where children are on the threshold of being taken away	CF was trying to cross-examine the first witness, but she actually seemed to be quite concerned about some of the things coming out of the Government	3
they will have experienced a drop of 10% overall in their living standards	Ruth is not in those cases wholly opposed to family intervention programmes	3
You’re kidding CF	People have survived that for centuries	3
there’s parents with mental health problems who have lost their ability to care for their children	They’re both trouble to those within their family, particularly their children, and their and those around them	3
they have lost their ability to do that	You may have more or less of it, the scale may shift, the relativities may shift, but you do have poverty to deal with.	3
what she was really talking about is forcing people to adapt to their conditions of poverty, rather than challenging those conditions or creating conditions where moral behaviour could better flourish.	Whether it means interfering in those families being able to conduct a flourishing life; whether it’s intervening in their property, in their bodily integrity; in their mental wellbeing by continuous harassment or nuisance.	3
there is a definitional problem here	the figures are a moral issue	3
Christian does not realize that it isn’t necessarily coming from a poor background that determines what happens in the future. Or in fact a wonderful loving family, you can end up as some dissipated wreck, alcoholic millionaire kid	we should be very circumspect in the way we intervene in families,	3
they might find it coercive.	if you look at the figures, fatherlessness, family breakdown, is disproportionately represented in all these social problems. 	3
it’s about creating conditions for them to make their own decisions	what is the good life? is the question	3
AM felt more strongly against that even than Melanie,	there’s two ways we can look at this	3
the household has a low income	it seems entirely unclear	3
it’s right to intervene	a number of these families exist who do cause problems to the children who grow up in them, and the people around them.	3
a number of these families exist who do cause problems to the children who grow up in them, and the people around them.	not from the direction Professor Levitas’s coming from	3
if you would like to consider the concept of non domination, freedom as non domination – the non interference on arbitrary grounds in people’s important decisions – then we have to be careful that when we do intervene it’s to increase total non domination. Which would mean not interfering simply because people are mad, sad and bad, but because they are imposing domination on their neighbours	Liberal societies have often known that the family can be a nexus for forms of unequal opportunity	3
if a child's brought up into a poor family that's not going to make the family's life worse	Helen would like social workers, the State, to teach people to do xxx	3
state intervention only seems to be coercive state intervention in the lives and families of the poor	these families, and the problems they face, have many causes, complicated, springing from social structures, cultural attitudes, all sorts of things	3
that's not a specific example	It’s very difficult to parent well in those circumstances.	3
what AM's surely ignoring, and what so much of their discussion this evening has ignored, is that there are deserts around our country where there is just serial misery and hopelessness, and despair, and dysfunctionality	they respond well to the framework in which you give them that help.	3
you can get people to effectively adapt to the conditions in which they live	the initiative is ‘troubled families’, not ‘troublesome families’.	3
It’s created a lot of victims who now need help themselves, and who sometimes go on to create other victims through crime	If we want to live in a Liberal society that is also tolerant, we must have a set of principles that we all digest and understand, that ground and explain, and justify why we behave as we do	3
there’s a danger here that Christian basically cannot see a possibility of breaking this, or people breaking it themselves	a situation in which Helen would tell a woman that she shouldn’t have a child, or another child would be xxx	3
Really horrible things might have happened to them	Evidence shows that lack of marriage leads to poverty	3
that is the moral way of getting people to pay their rent on time	that is not quite in all this	3
the problem of social justice is these 120,000 families	there are high levels of concern over their ability to care for their children	3
they cannot cope with the consequences of this progressive and incremental social family breakdown. 	and it’s fundamentally immoral	3
what we need to do to deal with poverty is to deal with problem families	It’s created a lot of victims who now need help themselves, and who sometimes go on to create other victims through crime	3
It’s created a lot of victims who now need help themselves, and who sometimes go on to create other victims through crime	It can be both	3
there are many families bringing up children without fathers very well.	they might find it coercive.	3
this is about compassion, social justice, giving these families a chance and no longer writing them off and leaving them on a social scrapheap.	You’re just basically told you’re not up to it.	3
Claire doesn't want a State – or Helen, to have a kind of normative view of what good parenting is	There are many families, and Louise Casey has this in mind, where for a variety of reasons a lone mother – and it’s usually a lone mother – cannot look after her children properly, doesn’t know how to very often	3
the issue is not one of poverty and resources	all will be well	3
Helen would go and work in families’ homes, working alongside them to achieve change, and that change would be around improving the circumstances for their children, and making them safe	It’s estimated 17% more children will fall into that group by 2015	3
KM said nothing of the sort	In MP's long list of ills that are suffered by this family there are some things that would be justifiable grounds and other things that wouldn't be	3
they are surely to be presumed to be capable of being helped in a way that allows them to live independent lives.	the conditions under which people live aren’t conducive to moral flourishing, and therefore what you want to do is challenge those conditions, change them	3
They are left absolutely high and dry,	MP and RL’re talking here about poor people being moral agents,	3
this means nothing	we’ve got ourselves into a complete mess in defining who troubled families are	3
we’re in a position now where there isn’t enough housing, and where actually some of the parents suggest if you’re agoraphobic you can’t go out to pay rent.	It’s actually rather immoral to come up with this kind of structurally derived argument that says, “Your job is really – or our job, collectively – is just to say to people ‘we will not put up with these situations and encourage political action’”.	3
As a result of this Government’s policies there will be more children in that situation	Claire would be all for reforming the welfare system and education	3
Melanie doesn’t want to get bogged down into a discussion about a figure	That means not simply looking at the individual, but to change the conditions and provide those sorts of conditions.	3
it’s right to tackle the problem of troubled families	families don't really have much agency themselves	3
there’s a danger here that Christian basically cannot see a possibility of breaking this, or people breaking it themselves	If you look at these things, as anyone in work would look at, if you can’t afford to have children the State should not step in and say “Unconditionally, we will support you if you make the decision to have children you can’t afford”	3
their particular problems were entirely resultant of the circumstances in which they found themselves	they will have experienced a drop of 10% overall in their living standards	3
in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	There’s an upfront, and later.	3
this emphasis on the individual moral shortcomings of parents is overly simplistic and doesn’t help	a Liberal society has an absolute moral duty to go and help those people, especially the child	3
they might not find it coercive	That’s a very sort of, cost/benefit analysis approach to social policy and family life	3
