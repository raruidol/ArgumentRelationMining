Dutch bankers have to take an oath	I gather Dutch bankers don’t just have rules and regulations	0
what they declare is the following: they start their oath with saying “I declare that I will perform my duties as a banker with integrity and care, and I will consider carefully all the interests involved in the bank. The clients, the shareholders, the employees and the society in which the bank operates, and then there are five or six lines that continue	It’s meant to make a difference	0
I would give, as one example of an organisation that’s changed, the BBC actually, which now tends to be pretty truthful even if only because it wasn’t in the past.	I believe this is capable of reform if we introduce codes, if we stigmatise bad behaviour, if we set about within organisations making sure the codes are adhered to.	0
They don’t explain what ethical behaviour is,	I think the interesting thing is that banks do have codes of ethics, but to the extent they have them they are incredibly disappointing, if not total crap.	0
by and large a large chunk of the codes of ethics – as they’re supposedly called – actually protects shareholders and doesn’t protect customers.	I think the interesting thing is that banks do have codes of ethics, but to the extent they have them they are incredibly disappointing, if not total crap.	0
they aren’t really implemented in any sensible way within the institutions.	I think the interesting thing is that banks do have codes of ethics, but to the extent they have them they are incredibly disappointing, if not total crap.	0
you have to follow the rules, and you have to know the rules and you have to have the power to stick to the rules	Rules are what determine morality	0
If you have exemplars	that will help you to follow these rules	0
we might for instance want banks to split and to ring fence retail banking from high risk investment for instance	Some regulation might help	0
we shouldn’t be too optimistic there that we can develop regulation that makes banks change their cultures	I don’t think that there is an ethical regulation	0
There is no evidence that that’s going to work	we shouldn’t be too optimistic there that we can develop regulation that makes banks change their cultures	0
It doesn't presuppose a God	that presupposes a God, or at least a recording angel to see our misdeeds when we commit them.	1
what it requires is that at the top of an organisation, there are angels in a certain sense	It doesn't presuppose a God	0
angels are very difficult to select, but it has to start at the top	what it requires is that at the top of an organisation, there are angels in a certain sense	0
There is lots of research been done to how cultures are being changed; it’s very difficult, but one things is very clear: if there is something rotten at the top, there is no hope for reform at the bottom	angels are very difficult to select, but it has to start at the top	0
the investment banks because the global economy is big. If you want to cut the investment banking industry down to size, slash the global economy – it’s not a terribly great idea.	Barclay's is an institution that can't carry on.	1
You take someone like Bob Diamond, in other industries he would have been sent off for two years to run branch banking so he knew more about it, before becoming a group Chief Executive.	Investment banks historically haven’t invested in training their management, and that’s a real problem.	0
investment banks have high complexity	Investment Banks are just too dangerous now as environments.	0
we’re seeing this with the Barclays example	bosses don’t really know what’s going on	0
the very existence of these institutions which have so much power	we’re seeing this with the Barclays example	0
there’s a lack of investment in management training	Investment banks historically haven’t invested in training their management, and that’s a real problem.	2
that helps perpetuate a very nasty culture within some of the banks	there’s a lack of investment in management training	0
I do not believe in free, free, free market Capitalism, as if there’s absolutely no regulation whatsoever.	by hitching society’s wellbeing to free market Capitalism we’ve made a pact with the devil we can’t get out of	0
people are being incentivised to take huge amounts of risks, with my money.	There’s all sorts of things to be said for Capitalism, but Capitalism is also a dangerous thing	0
It can’t be shamed into good behaviour, or even punished into good behaviour.	corporations have no souls to damn and no bodies to kick.	0
I’m talking about the essential shell of a company that it is actually essentially amoral. It’s not a person is it, in the sense that you and I are. It doesn’t have a conscience; it can’t be shamed. that morality is bound to affect the way people behave who work for it	it is inevitable that the essential immorality of business will infect the way individuals behave who work for it	2
they’re going to try and serve its purposes	I’m talking about the essential shell of a company that it is actually essentially amoral. It’s not a person is it, in the sense that you and I are. It doesn’t have a conscience; it can’t be shamed. that morality is bound to affect the way people behave who work for it	0
the way in which our politicians defer to it and so forth, that’s the nature of the problem, it’s not the problem of business per se.	there is a problem with the way in which, specifically the City of London, has become so large in our economy, out of all proportion to the other things.	0
Investment banks have to become environments where the risk, all the risk, falls on the people within the institutions.	When cars were made safer, initially what happened what drivers just drove more dangerously because cars are very individualistic environments. Someone suggested that the only thing you could do was put a six inch nail in the steering wheel, pointing out at the driver – isn’t that what we have to do with investment banks?	0
someone will always find a way around a rule.	I think in order to change investment banks you have to actually focus on not just specific rules, which in the introduction was described as ‘box ticking’,	0
You have to enforce a culture that makes people think broadly about ethics; that has to come from both outside and inside.	I think in order to change investment banks you have to actually focus on not just specific rules, which in the introduction was described as ‘box ticking’,	0
The outside impetus is the equivalent of your spike in the steering wheel, and I think that’s necessary.	You have to enforce a culture that makes people think broadly about ethics; that has to come from both outside and inside.	0
I think there needs to be a broad based ethical obligation on board,	I think in order to change investment banks you have to actually focus on not just specific rules, which in the introduction was described as ‘box ticking’,	0
so that you can go after them in the same way that in sectors that are really important to people’s lives, like water or nuclear power, there’s criminal liability on company directors.	I think there needs to be a broad based ethical obligation on board,	0
I think in order to change investment banks you have to actually focus on not just specific rules, which in the introduction was described as ‘box ticking’,	Investment banks have to become environments where the risk, all the risk, falls on the people within the institutions.	0
They manage risk	I think investment banking is basically necessary.	0
If you didn’t have investment banking, you’d have to recreate it.	I think investment banking is basically necessary.	0
yes you can have a different structure for the industry, but you end up back with investment banks.	I think investment banking is basically necessary.	0
Many people would raise their eyebrows at the idea that investment banks are successful in terms of managing risks.	They manage risk	1
Maybe in terms of managing risks to people who work in investment banks, not so much for the rest of us. 	Many people would raise their eyebrows at the idea that investment banks are successful in terms of managing risks.	0
if the integrated investment banks can’t actually manage their activities on a sensible ethical basis	clearly there may have to be some structural change	0
No absolutely not.	The system itself is not intrinsically corrupt; it’s just a few bad apples who can be dealt with by tweaking the rules.	1
it seems to me that the City of London is now very widely – I mean, people are very, very angry about what’s happened. They’re very widely seen as almost a conspiracy against the common good in as much as there is a huge amount of greed	You are just scapegoating an entire bunch of people, the vast majority of whom one has no reason to believe do anything other than behave with honesty and integrity.	1
ordinary people are feeling very ripped off by what’s happened in the City.	it seems to me that the City of London is now very widely – I mean, people are very, very angry about what’s happened. They’re very widely seen as almost a conspiracy against the common good in as much as there is a huge amount of greed	0
No, no, no. I think there are good and bad. I wasn’t talking about the people; I’m talking about systemic.	you have just demonised an entire group of people.	1
It’s not about bad apples, that always seems to be a bit of a distraction that you just focus on a few individuals.	No absolutely not.	0
the same is true for hospitals and schools and journalism	No that’s not possible, but that’s not something we should try to aim at	0
I think it’s not going to help change the culture	in banking we’ve a totally different situation	0
that is that when discussing moral issues, and they have sworn an oath at some point, that the oath can help give them an extra motivation to stay.	There is an advantage to oaths that we should realise, that we should recognise	0
they reflect the standards of business generally	a lot of those investment bankers who have been pilloried haven’t been losing their clients	2
they think they’re all pretty rotten so they don’t see any particular point in moving from Barclays to Lloyds	I think a lot of people would like to reject their bank, but they find it practically difficult to do so	0
I think many clients if they felt they had a real choice, would leave the banks that have been disgraced	they think they’re all pretty rotten so they don’t see any particular point in moving from Barclays to Lloyds	0
to make it insist on much more neutrality	You need laws that redefine what banking is	0
Those different structures relate to a different sense of what the purpose of money is	you can’t separate morals from practice	0
otherwise I don’t receive self-respect	you have the sense that it’s okay to make a reasonable profit, but I’ve got to have a social purpose as well	0
you have the sense that it’s okay to make a reasonable profit, but I’ve got to have a social purpose as well	Those different structures relate to a different sense of what the purpose of money is	0
you can’t separate morals from practice	they are moral	0
they are moral	these are banking reforms, they’re not moral	1
I think the problem is much more complicated than that	I think you are simplifying your duality.	0
I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	I think the problem is much more complicated than that	0
who are major benefactors	I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	0
who spend their Christmases manning soup kitchens.	I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	0
Think about Bill Gates and all the wonderful things that his money is doing.	I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	0
the history of America shows that.	Some of the people who are doing these wonderful things, and show that they value things in life well beyond money, are also somehow running these really crooked organisation	0
It’s often kind of guilt money coming out	the history of America shows that.	0
I wasn’t suggesting that it was guilt money	It’s often kind of guilt money coming out	1
I was suggesting something rather more optimistic; that actually banking is full of really rather splendid people.	I wasn’t suggesting that it was guilt money	0
There used to be codes operating, professional associations used to discipline people much more clearly	Banking, like so much else, has become deprofessionalised.	0
we’ve partly privatised morality	Banking, like so much else, has become deprofessionalised.	0
we’ve stopped thinking of morality as something continuous, something that permeates your whole life, your whole work.	we’ve partly privatised morality	0
the trouble with both Kantian and utilitarian morality is it only happens sometimes, we need to get back to the classics.	we’ve stopped thinking of morality as something continuous, something that permeates your whole life, your whole work.	0
there are many examples in society where these codes of proper conduct have continued	I think you exaggerate	0
the Armed Forces is one example	there are many examples in society where these codes of proper conduct have continued	0
they are the home of continuing morality in some ways	The Armed Forces is a very good example	0
The oath taken by the Queen is another very good example.	there are many examples in society where these codes of proper conduct have continued	0
If we live in a society where you get kudos for having just a whole lot of money, then people will pursue that	Humans flourish on recognition, social recognition	0
individual faith is not strong enough	in the end it’s culture not faith that might save us	0
It’s actually the culture of social norms which is what’s necessary for us to get this right	in the end it’s culture not faith that might save us	1
My suspicion is that if you don’t, in some sense, believe in a transcendent good – in other words that there’s an objective good, that there’s an objective goal for human beings	you’re going to fall back on this individualism and abstraction	0
you’re going to fall back on this individualism and abstraction	no, I actually think faith of all kinds, and approximations to faith, are incredibly important	0
no, I actually think faith of all kinds, and approximations to faith, are incredibly important	in the end it’s culture not faith that might save us	1
it’s pushed out all other values	the problem with freedom is it’s become a cuckoo value	0
it has to be understood amongst a basket of values including things like fairness	the problem with freedom is it’s become a cuckoo value	0
I think that the government has a very strong role in that.	I want Barclays to be less able – I think they should be smaller, I want to break it up, I want to break up the investment banking from retail banking; very, very specific.	0
Ethics relies upon, in some sense, hierarchy; some hierarchical authority, and in some sense a social purpose. But actually, neither of those things exist in investment banks	Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	0
Other companies, other organisations, have a sense of mission and also they have bosses who kind of know what’s going on.	Investment banks are characterised by a culture which is just pure exultant, rampant individualism.	0
Investment bankers work very hard for their clients; they provide a lot of intellectual input and a lot of intellectual stimulus for the economy as a whole. They provide some positives as well.	I think there is a cultural problem within that, but I don’t think that offsets completely the positive attributes of an investment bank.	0
I think there is a cultural problem within that, but I don’t think that offsets completely the positive attributes of an investment bank.	Investment banks are characterised by a culture which is just pure exultant, rampant individualism.	1
I think one interesting thing to look at is difference between the adverts that investment banks for clients in things like The Economist or The Financial Times, which say that they’re all about innovation and client service, and then the values that they espouse internally. Particularly during annual reviews, where what they’re after is people who are about making money, and are committed to making money for the firm.	I think there is a cultural problem within that, but I don’t think that offsets completely the positive attributes of an investment bank.	0
the benefit system is precisely one of those systems that encourages immoral behaviour	you seem to accept that idea of systemic	0
you seem to accept that idea of systemic	I don’t get this concept of systemic	1
that in my view damns people	That’s very different from saying that there is a kind of systemic rot in banking	0
I think the model of the ‘hidden hand’ has been vastly overplayed.	I think the way we run the economy is responsible for a decline in our morality	0
we’ve got this idea that if we all pursue our selfish interests, somehow harmony will result from that, and we’ve over extended that model	I think the model of the ‘hidden hand’ has been vastly overplayed.	0
we lack any sense of the common good	we’ve got this idea that if we all pursue our selfish interests, somehow harmony will result from that, and we’ve over extended that model	0
the only thing we hold in common is something abstract, which is money	we lack any sense of the common good	0
which is the supreme example of just that individualism and abstraction	that in turn reinforces the centrality of money, and particularly of finance capital	0
they find it hard to put the two at odds, and to understand that they ought to be leaning towards the common good and not towards personal and individual interest	People find it very difficult in a very strongly individualistic culture to understand what’s being meant by the phrase the common good	0
that’s a hard concept to get hold of in a very individualised society	they find it hard to put the two at odds, and to understand that they ought to be leaning towards the common good and not towards personal and individual interest	0
the free market system itself is based up on a very individualistic anthropology	they find it hard to put the two at odds, and to understand that they ought to be leaning towards the common good and not towards personal and individual interest	0
I think that we’re on a loser if we think that we’re going to get out of this by any kind of decline in individualism	People find it very difficult in a very strongly individualistic culture to understand what’s being meant by the phrase the common good	1
what I think we have to do is we have to have a deeper sense of individualism, where individualism is not simply about how much money you earn and how famous you are or whether you were on X Factor, but individualism that goes back to a more classical account of what individual fulfilment is and what it is to live the good life	I think that we’re on a loser if we think that we’re going to get out of this by any kind of decline in individualism	0
I think Michael Portillo is completely wrong	what I think we have to do is we have to have a deeper sense of individualism, where individualism is not simply about how much money you earn and how famous you are or whether you were on X Factor, but individualism that goes back to a more classical account of what individual fulfilment is and what it is to live the good life	1
this idea that because there were bad apples in the past nothing has changed for the worse, is the argument that’s used about crime; it’s a real cop out	I think Michael Portillo is completely wrong	0
I think individualism may be the way forward	I think Michael Portillo is completely wrong	1
if individuals take more responsibility for what they do, that is the way forward	I think individualism may be the way forward	0
That’s not individualism	if individuals take more responsibility for what they do, that is the way forward	1
We still defer to the Queen	They didn’t connect the two things, and the point is not to defend all forms of deference, but there is a sense in which, we used to defer to symbolic authority.	0
she represents justice and the common good	We still defer to the Queen	0
I think it’s more a matter of trying to shape	I don’t think rules are totally primary	0
individual faith, whatever it’s kind – religious faith or secular faith – faith is completely contingent on our social circumstances	that is a rather a gloomy view of faith	0
Not at all	individual faith, whatever it’s kind – religious faith or secular faith – faith is completely contingent on our social circumstances	1
the Christian faith like the Islamic faith has an account of the way these things should be socially organised	Not at all	0
It doesn’t expect that if you have a false set of structures, or a false set of purposes, that everything will be fine if you just have very good individuals	the Christian faith like the Islamic faith has an account of the way these things should be socially organised	0
the impact that investment banking has is so big	it is more dishonest than other walks of life, because of what it is and what it does	0
Because of the sums of money passing through the investment banks and the markets, they need to have higher standards of care than in other areas.	the impact that investment banking has is so big	0
Generally investment banking reflects business and commerce as a whole.	it is more dishonest than other walks of life, because of what it is and what it does	1
they are unethical rather than despite it	people are still going to investment banks with ethical problems.	0
people are still going to investment banks with ethical problems.	investment banks that have highly public ethical problems don’t lose their clients.	0

Ethical investment banking is a bit like tasteful lap dancing, you know, a kind of contradiction in terms.	It’s more than just impact.	0
One assumes they’re not very tasteful.  	Ethical investment banking is a bit like tasteful lap dancing, you know, a kind of contradiction in terms.	0
as we saw from the emails in the Barclays, the acknowledgement people in Barclays were getting, was they were getting acknowledgement from their colleagues for their bad behaviour	Unfortunately I just don’t think we can get away from the inherent complexity here, which is that rules can sometimes be good things and they can sometimes be bad things, but so can social norms	0
I’m sure they went down the pub afterwards and slapped each other on the back and said you’re a great member of the banker’s club	as we saw from the emails in the Barclays, the acknowledgement people in Barclays were getting, was they were getting acknowledgement from their colleagues for their bad behaviour	0
There is no simple way out of these kinds of dilemmas	it seems to me we have to somehow find – to educate people in the sense that they have to cope with this complexity	0
In every walk of life what really work, even in the economy, is when you negotiate what is reciprocally in your joint interests	what we need much more is a sense of reciprocity that it’s not just that my interest happens to coincide with yours.	0
we lack both reciprocity and teleology	what we need much more is a sense of reciprocity that it’s not just that my interest happens to coincide with yours.	0
there’s some very virtuous people who work in the City of London and do extraordinarily good things with their money.	I don’t mean to say that everybody within it concedes to that bad behaviour	0
No, no. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with people making a profit	Giles thinks that the banking industry, the City of London and Capitalism are upsetting and immoral.	1
If they take risks with their own money and they can lose their own money, then that’s absolutely fine.	No, no. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with people making a profit	0
I don’t have problems with hedge funds making a lot of money, the partnership model; if they go bust, they go bust.	If they take risks with their own money and they can lose their own money, then that’s absolutely fine.	0
they’re not just playing with their own money	it seems to me that’s it’s almost as if you had a water utility, a hybrid company of a water utility, and a casino and then when the casino goes bust they say “Well I’m terribly sorry, we’re a water utility really, so we can’t go bust.”	0
it seems to me that’s it’s almost as if you had a water utility, a hybrid company of a water utility, and a casino and then when the casino goes bust they say “Well I’m terribly sorry, we’re a water utility really, so we can’t go bust.”	The problem with the way we’ve got – I mean we’ve talked about investment banking here around this table, as if it’s just a thing on it’s own but actually it’s linked with retail banking.	0
That’s given us everything from sewage and welfare and trains, to museums and orchestras.	The inherent morality of money making in general, is that it has enriched us all.	0
what’s happening in the industrial revolution we’re experiencing at the moment, is precisely that 70% of the world is benefitting from it. Whereas the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century was confined to Europe and North America.	A good chunk of the world did notice the boom times that developed countries had.	0
some of the world is suffering from the impact of development on climate change, for example.	  I think that wealth creation has benefitted a lot of the world, but not all the world	0
you’re leaving out a good chunk of the world which is still sitting there in poverty and didn’t really notice the boom times that some of us had in the developed countries	there is one caveat	0

The origin of the word ‘credit’ is the Latin ‘Credere’ – to believe.	The basis of Capitalism is actually that it requires belief and trust and credit.	0
Without these things it doesn’t function.	The basis of Capitalism is actually that it requires belief and trust and credit.	0
The incidents of real ethical abuses, let alone criminal abuses, in investment banking is actually very small.	Yes, and even with these egregious examples of which I am the strongest possible critic, it is the case – because the system is still just about working – that trust and credit, and codes and mutuality and things like that still exist, to some extent.	0

My favourite story about that is Saint Francis of Assisi, who was so against money that he made his monks put a coin – if they got caught touching money they’d have to put a coin in their mouth and put it in a pile of dung, he hated money so much.

by hitching society’s wellbeing to free market Capitalism we’ve made a pact with the devil we can’t get out of	Rules are what determine morality	3
Ethics relies upon, in some sense, hierarchy; some hierarchical authority, and in some sense a social purpose. But actually, neither of those things exist in investment banks	I was suggesting something rather more optimistic; that actually banking is full of really rather splendid people.	3
they think they’re all pretty rotten so they don’t see any particular point in moving from Barclays to Lloyds	you famously welcomed the Occupy protesters to St Paul’s Cathedral	3
people are being incentivised to take huge amounts of risks, with my money.	there is an element in this of Christianity fetishising poverty	3
I welcomed them to the Church actually	what they declare is the following: they start their oath with saying “I declare that I will perform my duties as a banker with integrity and care, and I will consider carefully all the interests involved in the bank. The clients, the shareholders, the employees and the society in which the bank operates, and then there are five or six lines that continue	3
Banking, like so much else, has become deprofessionalised.	we’ve stopped thinking of morality as something continuous, something that permeates your whole life, your whole work.	3
the problem with freedom is it’s become a cuckoo value	No absolutely not.	3
by hitching society’s wellbeing to free market Capitalism we’ve made a pact with the devil we can’t get out of	people are being incentivised to take huge amounts of risks, with my money.	3
it’s pushed out all other values	you’re going to fall back on this individualism and abstraction	3
I think that competence is lacking in the banking industry	There is no simple way out of these kinds of dilemmas	3
I think investment banking is basically necessary.	my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	3
Investment banks historically haven’t invested in training their management, and that’s a real problem.	It’s more than just impact.	3
that is something that we don’t read in the newspapers every day	It’s not about bad apples, that always seems to be a bit of a distraction that you just focus on a few individuals.	3
bosses don’t really know what’s going on	I gather Dutch bankers don’t just have rules and regulations	3
I don’t get this concept of systemic	that helps perpetuate a very nasty culture within some of the banks	3
I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	When cars were made safer, initially what happened what drivers just drove more dangerously because cars are very individualistic environments. Someone suggested that the only thing you could do was put a six inch nail in the steering wheel, pointing out at the driver – isn’t that what we have to do with investment banks?	3
I was suggesting something rather more optimistic; that actually banking is full of really rather splendid people.	we might for instance want banks to split and to ring fence retail banking from high risk investment for instance	3
they’re not just playing with their own money	there is one caveat	3
it seems to me that the City of London is now very widely – I mean, people are very, very angry about what’s happened. They’re very widely seen as almost a conspiracy against the common good in as much as there is a huge amount of greed	A good chunk of the world did notice the boom times that developed countries had.	3
it is more dishonest than other walks of life, because of what it is and what it does	I think many clients if they felt they had a real choice, would leave the banks that have been disgraced	3
Boudewijn thinks ther is no wider cultural problem	she represents justice and the common good	3
we shouldn’t be too optimistic there that we can develop regulation that makes banks change their cultures	it seems to me we have to somehow find – to educate people in the sense that they have to cope with this complexity	3
They manage risk	That’s given us everything from sewage and welfare and trains, to museums and orchestras.	3
The system itself is not intrinsically corrupt; it’s just a few bad apples who can be dealt with by tweaking the rules.	as we saw from the emails in the Barclays, the acknowledgement people in Barclays were getting, was they were getting acknowledgement from their colleagues for their bad behaviour	3
it seems to me that the City of London is now very widely – I mean, people are very, very angry about what’s happened. They’re very widely seen as almost a conspiracy against the common good in as much as there is a huge amount of greed	it has to be understood amongst a basket of values including things like fairness	3
people are still going to investment banks with ethical problems.	My suspicion is that if you don’t, in some sense, believe in a transcendent good – in other words that there’s an objective good, that there’s an objective goal for human beings	3
people are still going to investment banks with ethical problems.	these are banking reforms, they’re not moral	3
they are moral	You take someone like Bob Diamond, in other industries he would have been sent off for two years to run branch banking so he knew more about it, before becoming a group Chief Executive.	3
Investment banks are characterised by a culture which is just pure exultant, rampant individualism.	if the integrated investment banks can’t actually manage their activities on a sensible ethical basis	3
they think they’re all pretty rotten so they don’t see any particular point in moving from Barclays to Lloyds	Some regulation might help	3
I think in order to change investment banks you have to actually focus on not just specific rules, which in the introduction was described as ‘box ticking’,	I think the model of the ‘hidden hand’ has been vastly overplayed.	3
Think about Bill Gates and all the wonderful things that his money is doing.	If we live in a society where you get kudos for having just a whole lot of money, then people will pursue that	3
they reflect the standards of business generally	they find it hard to put the two at odds, and to understand that they ought to be leaning towards the common good and not towards personal and individual interest	3
we’ve stopped thinking of morality as something continuous, something that permeates your whole life, your whole work.	individual faith, whatever it’s kind – religious faith or secular faith – faith is completely contingent on our social circumstances	3
there is an element in this of Christianity fetishising poverty	I want Barclays to be less able – I think they should be smaller, I want to break it up, I want to break up the investment banking from retail banking; very, very specific.	3
I think Michael Portillo is completely wrong	There used to be codes operating, professional associations used to discipline people much more clearly	3
clearly there may have to be some structural change	they are moral	3
that is that when discussing moral issues, and they have sworn an oath at some point, that the oath can help give them an extra motivation to stay.	Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	3
she represents justice and the common good	I’m sure they went down the pub afterwards and slapped each other on the back and said you’re a great member of the banker’s club	3
People find it very difficult in a very strongly individualistic culture to understand what’s being meant by the phrase the common good	some of the world is suffering from the impact of development on climate change, for example.	3
Investment banks are characterised by a culture which is just pure exultant, rampant individualism.	I’m talking about the essential shell of a company that it is actually essentially amoral. It’s not a person is it, in the sense that you and I are. It doesn’t have a conscience; it can’t be shamed. that morality is bound to affect the way people behave who work for it	3
Those different structures relate to a different sense of what the purpose of money is	Generally investment banking reflects business and commerce as a whole.	3
A good chunk of the world did notice the boom times that developed countries had.	No that’s not possible, but that’s not something we should try to aim at	3
Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	we’ve got this idea that if we all pursue our selfish interests, somehow harmony will result from that, and we’ve over extended that model	3
No, no, no. I think there are good and bad. I wasn’t talking about the people; I’m talking about systemic.	the benefit system is precisely one of those systems that encourages immoral behaviour	3
Not at all	a lot of those investment bankers who have been pilloried haven’t been losing their clients	3
it has to be understood amongst a basket of values including things like fairness	this idea that because there were bad apples in the past nothing has changed for the worse, is the argument that’s used about crime; it’s a real cop out	3
There is lots of research been done to how cultures are being changed; it’s very difficult, but one things is very clear: if there is something rotten at the top, there is no hope for reform at the bottom	the free market system itself is based up on a very individualistic anthropology	3
we’ve stopped thinking of morality as something continuous, something that permeates your whole life, your whole work.	what’s happening in the industrial revolution we’re experiencing at the moment, is precisely that 70% of the world is benefitting from it. Whereas the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century was confined to Europe and North America.	3
otherwise I don’t receive self-respect	Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	3
  I think that wealth creation has benefitted a lot of the world, but not all the world	it is more dishonest than other walks of life, because of what it is and what it does	3
There’s all sorts of things to be said for Capitalism, but Capitalism is also a dangerous thing	we’ve partly privatised morality	3
Think about Bill Gates and all the wonderful things that his money is doing.	we’re seeing this with the Barclays example	3
The inherent morality of money making in general, is that it has enriched us all.	It doesn’t expect that if you have a false set of structures, or a false set of purposes, that everything will be fine if you just have very good individuals	3
that is a rather a gloomy view of faith	they think they’re all pretty rotten so they don’t see any particular point in moving from Barclays to Lloyds	3
It can’t be shamed into good behaviour, or even punished into good behaviour.	In every walk of life what really work, even in the economy, is when you negotiate what is reciprocally in your joint interests	3
I think it’s more a matter of trying to shape	we might for instance want banks to split and to ring fence retail banking from high risk investment for instance	3
My suspicion is that if you don’t, in some sense, believe in a transcendent good – in other words that there’s an objective good, that there’s an objective goal for human beings	There is no evidence that that’s going to work	3
You talk about greed; people are indeed very angry about large bankers bonuses.	the Christian faith like the Islamic faith has an account of the way these things should be socially organised	3
Without these things it doesn’t function.	I don’t mean to say that everybody within it concedes to that bad behaviour	3
we lack any sense of the common good	some of the world is suffering from the impact of development on climate change, for example.	3
by hitching society’s wellbeing to free market Capitalism we’ve made a pact with the devil we can’t get out of	The system itself is not intrinsically corrupt; it’s just a few bad apples who can be dealt with by tweaking the rules.	3
Ethical investment banking is a bit like tasteful lap dancing, you know, a kind of contradiction in terms.	I think individualism may be the way forward	3
she represents justice and the common good	investment banks have high complexity	3
One assumes they’re not very tasteful.  	it seems to me we have to somehow find – to educate people in the sense that they have to cope with this complexity	3
I think you are simplifying your duality.	Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	3
Boudewijn thinks ther is no wider cultural problem	the history of America shows that.	3
what it requires is that at the top of an organisation, there are angels in a certain sense	investment banks have high complexity	3
The origin of the word ‘credit’ is the Latin ‘Credere’ – to believe.	I think the way we run the economy is responsible for a decline in our morality	3
I would give, as one example of an organisation that’s changed, the BBC actually, which now tends to be pretty truthful even if only because it wasn’t in the past.	you can’t separate morals from practice	3
they’re going to try and serve its purposes	to make it insist on much more neutrality	3
There is no simple way out of these kinds of dilemmas	Some of the people who are doing these wonderful things, and show that they value things in life well beyond money, are also somehow running these really crooked organisation	3
investment banks have high complexity	there’s some very virtuous people who work in the City of London and do extraordinarily good things with their money.	3
if the integrated investment banks can’t actually manage their activities on a sensible ethical basis	they aren’t really implemented in any sensible way within the institutions.	3
It’s not about bad apples, that always seems to be a bit of a distraction that you just focus on a few individuals.	It can’t be shamed into good behaviour, or even punished into good behaviour.	3
Because of the sums of money passing through the investment banks and the markets, they need to have higher standards of care than in other areas.	I think the interesting thing is that banks do have codes of ethics, but to the extent they have them they are incredibly disappointing, if not total crap.	3
There is an advantage to oaths that we should realise, that we should recognise	the trouble with both Kantian and utilitarian morality is it only happens sometimes, we need to get back to the classics.	3
Investment bankers work very hard for their clients; they provide a lot of intellectual input and a lot of intellectual stimulus for the economy as a whole. They provide some positives as well.	A good chunk of the world did notice the boom times that developed countries had.	3
I think one interesting thing to look at is difference between the adverts that investment banks for clients in things like The Economist or The Financial Times, which say that they’re all about innovation and client service, and then the values that they espouse internally. Particularly during annual reviews, where what they’re after is people who are about making money, and are committed to making money for the firm.

the Armed Forces is one example	individual faith is not strong enough	3
that is that when discussing moral issues, and they have sworn an oath at some point, that the oath can help give them an extra motivation to stay.	they are the home of continuing morality in some ways	3
in the end it’s culture not faith that might save us	the same is true for hospitals and schools and journalism	3

I think the interesting thing is that banks do have codes of ethics, but to the extent they have them they are incredibly disappointing, if not total crap.	Christianity is very ambivalent about money.	3
Rules are what determine morality	so that you can go after them in the same way that in sectors that are really important to people’s lives, like water or nuclear power, there’s criminal liability on company directors.	3
The oath taken by the Queen is another very good example.	It doesn’t expect that if you have a false set of structures, or a false set of purposes, that everything will be fine if you just have very good individuals	3
That’s given us everything from sewage and welfare and trains, to museums and orchestras.	what they declare is the following: they start their oath with saying “I declare that I will perform my duties as a banker with integrity and care, and I will consider carefully all the interests involved in the bank. The clients, the shareholders, the employees and the society in which the bank operates, and then there are five or six lines that continue	3
  I think that wealth creation has benefitted a lot of the world, but not all the world	People find it very difficult in a very strongly individualistic culture to understand what’s being meant by the phrase the common good	3
Investment bankers work very hard for their clients; they provide a lot of intellectual input and a lot of intellectual stimulus for the economy as a whole. They provide some positives as well.	they are unethical rather than despite it	3
it has to be understood amongst a basket of values including things like fairness	Other companies, other organisations, have a sense of mission and also they have bosses who kind of know what’s going on.	3
they find it hard to put the two at odds, and to understand that they ought to be leaning towards the common good and not towards personal and individual interest	It’s more than just impact.	3
I think many clients if they felt they had a real choice, would leave the banks that have been disgraced	You talk about greed; people are indeed very angry about large bankers bonuses.	3
There used to be codes operating, professional associations used to discipline people much more clearly	I think that if you look at trust in the banking sector, we’ve seen that it’s been declining to very low levels	3
I don’t have problems with hedge funds making a lot of money, the partnership model; if they go bust, they go bust.	it seems to me we have to somehow find – to educate people in the sense that they have to cope with this complexity	3
the very existence of these institutions which have so much power	You need laws that redefine what banking is	3
Investment banks have to become environments where the risk, all the risk, falls on the people within the institutions.	there is a problem with the way in which, specifically the City of London, has become so large in our economy, out of all proportion to the other things.	3
they find it hard to put the two at odds, and to understand that they ought to be leaning towards the common good and not towards personal and individual interest	No absolutely not.	3
you have just demonised an entire group of people.	I welcomed them to the Church actually	3
You have to enforce a culture that makes people think broadly about ethics; that has to come from both outside and inside.	Because of the sums of money passing through the investment banks and the markets, they need to have higher standards of care than in other areas.	3
Those different structures relate to a different sense of what the purpose of money is	Some of the people who are doing these wonderful things, and show that they value things in life well beyond money, are also somehow running these really crooked organisation	3
you have the sense that it’s okay to make a reasonable profit, but I’ve got to have a social purpose as well	if individuals take more responsibility for what they do, that is the way forward	3
that in turn reinforces the centrality of money, and particularly of finance capital	what’s happening in the industrial revolution we’re experiencing at the moment, is precisely that 70% of the world is benefitting from it. Whereas the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century was confined to Europe and North America.	3
they’re going to try and serve its purposes	I don’t think that there is an ethical regulation	3
you have the sense that it’s okay to make a reasonable profit, but I’ve got to have a social purpose as well	she represents justice and the common good	3
I think a lot of people would like to reject their bank, but they find it practically difficult to do so	Investment banks have to become environments where the risk, all the risk, falls on the people within the institutions.	3
Investment Banks are just too dangerous now as environments.	It’s not about bad apples, that always seems to be a bit of a distraction that you just focus on a few individuals.	3
that in my view damns people	If they take risks with their own money and they can lose their own money, then that’s absolutely fine.	3
You need laws that redefine what banking is	You talk about greed; people are indeed very angry about large bankers bonuses.	3
That’s very different from saying that there is a kind of systemic rot in banking	I think the way we run the economy is responsible for a decline in our morality	3
I think a lot of people would like to reject their bank, but they find it practically difficult to do so	the same is true for hospitals and schools and journalism	3
it seems to me we have to somehow find – to educate people in the sense that they have to cope with this complexity	there is one caveat	3
I think there needs to be a broad based ethical obligation on board,	you have the sense that it’s okay to make a reasonable profit, but I’ve got to have a social purpose as well	3
I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	they are the home of continuing morality in some ways	3
there’s a lack of investment in management training	Banking, like so much else, has become deprofessionalised.	3
I think that we’re on a loser if we think that we’re going to get out of this by any kind of decline in individualism	that presupposes a God, or at least a recording angel to see our misdeeds when we commit them.	3
Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	You talk about greed; people are indeed very angry about large bankers bonuses.	3
someone will always find a way around a rule.	if individuals take more responsibility for what they do, that is the way forward	3
in the end it’s culture not faith that might save us	you have just demonised an entire group of people.	3
corporations have no souls to damn and no bodies to kick.	a lot of those investment bankers who have been pilloried haven’t been losing their clients	3
Investment Banks are just too dangerous now as environments.	my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	3
what we need much more is a sense of reciprocity that it’s not just that my interest happens to coincide with yours.	I don’t have problems with hedge funds making a lot of money, the partnership model; if they go bust, they go bust.	3
Ethics relies upon, in some sense, hierarchy; some hierarchical authority, and in some sense a social purpose. But actually, neither of those things exist in investment banks	I think individualism may be the way forward	3
they are unethical rather than despite it	Christianity is very ambivalent about money.	3
the investment banks because the global economy is big. If you want to cut the investment banking industry down to size, slash the global economy – it’s not a terribly great idea.	no, I actually think faith of all kinds, and approximations to faith, are incredibly important	3
I don’t think that there is an ethical regulation	I don’t mean to say that everybody within it concedes to that bad behaviour	3
you famously welcomed the Occupy protesters to St Paul’s Cathedral	my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	3
The system itself is not intrinsically corrupt; it’s just a few bad apples who can be dealt with by tweaking the rules.	I think Michael Portillo is completely wrong	3
they are unethical rather than despite it	we shouldn’t be too optimistic there that we can develop regulation that makes banks change their cultures	3
Those different structures relate to a different sense of what the purpose of money is	if the integrated investment banks can’t actually manage their activities on a sensible ethical basis	3
I was suggesting something rather more optimistic; that actually banking is full of really rather splendid people.	you can’t separate morals from practice	3
that’s a hard concept to get hold of in a very individualised society	If they take risks with their own money and they can lose their own money, then that’s absolutely fine.	3
You take someone like Bob Diamond, in other industries he would have been sent off for two years to run branch banking so he knew more about it, before becoming a group Chief Executive.	this idea that because there were bad apples in the past nothing has changed for the worse, is the argument that’s used about crime; it’s a real cop out	3
I think the model of the ‘hidden hand’ has been vastly overplayed.	If we live in a society where you get kudos for having just a whole lot of money, then people will pursue that	3
Banking, like so much else, has become deprofessionalised.	what I think we have to do is we have to have a deeper sense of individualism, where individualism is not simply about how much money you earn and how famous you are or whether you were on X Factor, but individualism that goes back to a more classical account of what individual fulfilment is and what it is to live the good life	3
the history of America shows that.	investment banks have high complexity	3
I think that we’re on a loser if we think that we’re going to get out of this by any kind of decline in individualism	Many people would raise their eyebrows at the idea that investment banks are successful in terms of managing risks.	3
there’s a lack of investment in management training	what’s happening in the industrial revolution we’re experiencing at the moment, is precisely that 70% of the world is benefitting from it. Whereas the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century was confined to Europe and North America.	3
if individuals take more responsibility for what they do, that is the way forward	we lack any sense of the common good	3
we lack both reciprocity and teleology	the trouble with both Kantian and utilitarian morality is it only happens sometimes, we need to get back to the classics.	3
that helps perpetuate a very nasty culture within some of the banks	I think it’s not going to help change the culture	3
you have the sense that it’s okay to make a reasonable profit, but I’ve got to have a social purpose as well	who are major benefactors	3
I don’t think rules are totally primary	Investment banks are characterised by a culture which is just pure exultant, rampant individualism.	3
that is that when discussing moral issues, and they have sworn an oath at some point, that the oath can help give them an extra motivation to stay.	I don’t get this concept of systemic	3
Ethics relies upon, in some sense, hierarchy; some hierarchical authority, and in some sense a social purpose. But actually, neither of those things exist in investment banks	A good chunk of the world did notice the boom times that developed countries had.	3
That’s very different from saying that there is a kind of systemic rot in banking	I think one interesting thing to look at is difference between the adverts that investment banks for clients in things like The Economist or The Financial Times, which say that they’re all about innovation and client service, and then the values that they espouse internally. Particularly during annual reviews, where what they’re after is people who are about making money, and are committed to making money for the firm.	3
the way in which our politicians defer to it and so forth, that’s the nature of the problem, it’s not the problem of business per se.	we’re seeing this with the Barclays example	3
Boudewijn thinks there is no real banking problem, apart from a few rotten apples	I think the way we run the economy is responsible for a decline in our morality	3
investment banks have high complexity	some of the world is suffering from the impact of development on climate change, for example.	3
that will help you to follow these rules	Boudewijn thinks there is no real banking problem, apart from a few rotten apples	3
Investment banks historically haven’t invested in training their management, and that’s a real problem.	we shouldn’t be too optimistic there that we can develop regulation that makes banks change their cultures	3
you have just demonised an entire group of people.	they aren’t really implemented in any sensible way within the institutions.	3
this idea that because there were bad apples in the past nothing has changed for the worse, is the argument that’s used about crime; it’s a real cop out	Some regulation might help	3
Some of the people who are doing these wonderful things, and show that they value things in life well beyond money, are also somehow running these really crooked organisation	That’s not individualism	3
I want Barclays to be less able – I think they should be smaller, I want to break it up, I want to break up the investment banking from retail banking; very, very specific.	you have to follow the rules, and you have to know the rules and you have to have the power to stick to the rules	3
the very existence of these institutions which have so much power	otherwise I don’t receive self-respect	3
That’s not individualism	I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	3
we might for instance want banks to split and to ring fence retail banking from high risk investment for instance	a lot of those investment bankers who have been pilloried haven’t been losing their clients	3
I think many clients if they felt they had a real choice, would leave the banks that have been disgraced	if individuals take more responsibility for what they do, that is the way forward	3
