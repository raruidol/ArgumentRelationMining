I think the relics of colonialism, racism and the current dystopia around in relation to people groping focus a kind of inclusive British citizenship that relieves them of the guilt of their - of the past, and opens up a vista of an inclusive future, actually relies on, to some extent, Britain having a truth and reconciliation moment,	For some people it is	3
they are due reparation	it very much depends which side you take it,	3
It wasn't that distant in moral terms from where we are now	the way they suffered was a crime	3
This is not all morally blameworthy	that plays against Matthew's point	3
there was xxx much sympathy generally around the table for Lee Jasper's view that some form of Mdeba moment, as he put it, reconciliation or acknowledgment of the sins of the past is something that we desperately require to bring about an inclusive multi-racial community	The key point about the British Empire is not necessarily that brutality does not happen but when it does	3
It's not a case of just legality	there should be a window of apology and getting back to common sense.	3
the context is colonialism	it is a good point Clifford makes	3
we are quite hung up about this	the context is colonialism	3
in almost any jurisdiction in the world it would be seen as a crime	The pragmatic justification is that they - if they are to take their case against anybody, we, this state, the British state now, is the closest they can get to it.	3
It seems to be a mixture of arrogance and absurdity	they did what they had to do in order to maintain a liberation struggle	3
They can be racially offensive	ES has just muddled up civil and criminal cases	3
these people are alive	bad things done under the Empire were an aberration	3
black people can't be racist in the United Kingdom context	people who are powerless cannot be prejudiced	3
The trains ran on crime	Britain is non-inclusive	3
there are many other survivors who do not currently have access to justice	CL would feel better if the people who had suffered that injustice were compensated	3
it's not brutal enough	JA does not think this particular court case might provide this Mdeba moment	3
what was interesting tonight is when you hear Lawrence James who was the second witness	those liabilities actually transferred back to the British Government	3
the situation in Kenya was a bloody dirty war	these are elderly victims	3
they are effectively trying to hand over to some kind of stable rule and in certain circumstances you have to suppress	Mr Cameron does not have to answer for the decisions of, say, Lord Palmerston	3
That is interesting	in almost any jurisdiction in the world it would be seen as a crime	3
if there are specific perpetrators, if you have a tyrant, if you have a group of military officers who are accused of committing a war crime, then for sure, there should be no statute of limitations in prosecuting them.	That's not what Esther stated	3
nothing horrible was done under the Empire	it's not brutal enough	3
there is an outstanding crime that has been committed	We don't look at it halfway through	3
it very much depends which side you take it,	I'm not saying that	3
it is a claim for compensation against the present government, which had no responsibility for what happened	Britain is non-inclusive	3
It is / is not JA's view that the history of colonialism, maybe the history of slavery, is responsible for racism in Britain	JA does not think this particular court case might provide this Mdeba moment	3
these were not terrorists	That's not good enough	3
these were not terrorists	moral justice lies xxx when we look back at our imperial past	3
it was a freedom struggle	They do bear responsibility.	3
they should be tried	in this particular case, what are crimes now were very much crimes then	3
the context for the atrocities having been carried out by agents of the British Government at the time, the context was the atrocities being carried out against them by the Mau Mau	that is / is not part of JA's case	3
the context for the atrocities having been carried out by agents of the British Government at the time, the context was the atrocities being carried out against them by the Mau Mau	it will be an important opportunity for the individuals to make their case	3
that plays against Matthew's point	that probably isn't enough for JA	3
They can be prejudiced against white people	we have xxx much legal responsibility for the actions of the past	3
JA has heard lots of judgments of people being found guilty of uttering racially offensive remarks without themselves being what JA would call a card carrying racist	They did see this as being like under the Third Reich in effect.	3
it is a good point Clifford makes	This took place in the colonial era	3
they are effectively trying to hand over to some kind of stable rule and in certain circumstances you have to suppress	that would not be the British Government's view	3
In terms of moral responsibility then it, is pretty much anything allowed to them because it was a struggle of liberation	it's not racism	3
and therefore the only way forward was for Britain to withdraw	That's not what Esther stated	3
as we all know, the moral case is absolutely unanswerable	This took place in the colonial era	3
the first and third witnesses didn't seem to draw much a distinction between the British Empire and the Third Reich.	they did what they had to do in order to maintain a liberation struggle	3
There are three people who it seems very likely suffered	it is a claim for compensation against the present government, which had no responsibility for what happened	3
they take us to questions we have still got to resolve.	the first and third witnesses didn't seem to draw much a distinction between the British Empire and the Third Reich.	3
that is a good case and something AM does take very seriously	the legacy of colonialism for white people is white privilege in the modern day setting.	3
justice would look like xxx	here you don't have specific perpetrators.	3
there is both a pragmatic and a historic justification	It was a ghastly aberration	3
It was in essence a tyranny	you can be convicted of being racially offensive without being a racist	3
MP raises an interesting point	if it's an emotional thing to do with blame and guilt, CL personally feels dishonoured by what was done in his name	3
there are not very specific perpetrators	when news first came of the horrific massacre of Mau Mau prisoners in Kenya. Wide swathes of British public opinion and the media and the Prime Minister and most of the Cabinet were horrified and disgusted then, not now, then	3
it's the British thing of legally examining it, and rationally going through the evidence and finding complete proof, total proof that these people suffered injuries in such a place in such a way, and that the officers who commanded them, then the judges and the lawyers can say how far are these agents of the British state	If there is an element of retrospective moral judgments, there are no problem with that	3
that is not going to make young black Britons feel better	there's a streak that says, it was a pretty balanced account, there's nothing wrong with colonialism	3
It was in essence a tyranny	there are many other survivors who do not currently have access to justice	3
you are stretching your definition in order to make the British Empire fit into that?	Esther would look at the context	3
it's not racism	the wider context is the colonial dispossession	3
you have to draw lines	Esther would not be also happy for them to face trial for atrocities committed against white settlers and British service personnel at the time	3
it is reasonable to argue that given what they went through, as the closest they can get to the people who perpetrated this is the British state, indeed the state benefitted from colonialism in a variety of ways, it's reasonable that they should seek recompense from the British state	there were insurgents as Melanie would call them	3
it's not brutal enough	in contrast to, say, America, you don't have a kind of polarisation between black and white here in the way that you do there.	3
Not to be in a funk when you are reading intelligence reports which suggest your Empire is under sustained assault	There are three people who it seems very likely suffered	3
that is a source of injustice	it's the British thing of legally examining it, and rationally going through the evidence and finding complete proof, total proof that these people suffered injuries in such a place in such a way, and that the officers who commanded them, then the judges and the lawyers can say how far are these agents of the British state	3
they are proceeding with it	It was a ghastly aberration	3
The are other instances that bring up questions about imperial rule	For decades, our children have been taught nothing other than the Empire was uniquely dreadful	3
the government has acknowledged that they were ill treated in court	they are proceeding with it	3
The Empire brought a lot of good things	It wasn't that distant in moral terms from where we are now	3
there were atrocities on both sides, including in this big group of people that Esther has just referred to	there were crimes against humanity	3
we have to look at it in that way	there's no statute of limitations for murder	3
those liabilities actually transferred back to the British Government	the wider context is the colonial dispossession	3
in contrast to, say, America, you don't have a kind of polarisation between black and white here in the way that you do there.	They can be prejudiced against white people	3
the context is colonialism	it would not be okay under these circumstances for, say, a holocaust victim to take a civil damages case against Angela Merkel	3
some of us would argue the case doesn't go far enough	We're looking at this case in a multiple ways	3
decided that this had taught an important lesson that the only way in which the British presence in Africa could be sustained was brutality	this is a live debate	3
The difference is that this was an aberration	here you don't have specific perpetrators.	3
The difference is that this was an aberration	in order to finance the trade and the extraction of resource in African countries, infrastructure was built and there was a degree of benevolence	3
it would not be okay under these circumstances for, say, a holocaust victim to take a civil damages case against Angela Merkel	the fireman has used too much water to quench the fire	3
it is reasonable to argue that given what they went through, as the closest they can get to the people who perpetrated this is the British state, indeed the state benefitted from colonialism in a variety of ways, it's reasonable that they should seek recompense from the British state	you are on the side of the nationalist movements which replaced the British Empire	3
the British state knew what they were doing 	and therefore the only way forward was for Britain to withdraw	3
in almost any jurisdiction in the world it would be seen as a crime	nothing horrible was done under the Empire	3
the context for the atrocities having been carried out by agents of the British Government at the time, the context was the atrocities being carried out against them by the Mau Mau	You have a specific perpetrator	3
that is a good case and something AM does take very seriously	it's a symbolic case, to open a wider door	3
it's a symbolic case, to open a wider door	This was a war of liberation	3
that takes ES xxx	Justice would be multi-facetted	3
you often have public inquiries and open investigations	the violence that the Mau Mau perpetrated against settlers and particularly loyal Africans xxx	3
This was a war of liberation	in this particular case, what are crimes now were very much crimes then	3
they do need to be compensated for the crimes that were committed against them	This was a war of liberation	3
bad things done under the Empire were an aberration	we don't have the perpetrators in court	3
MT was told it was generally speaking a good thing	colonialism is xxx	3
You have a specific perpetrator	it was a freedom struggle	3
You have a specific perpetrator	even if this hearing itself or the damages claims by these three individuals are concerned, it should / should not be the occasion for examining the colonial legacy	3
This is not all morally blameworthy	justice would look like xxx	3
we are quite hung up about this	I'm not saying that	3
in contrast to, say, America, you don't have a kind of polarisation between black and white here in the way that you do there.	a legal remedy exists	3
it was the product of a policy that was unsustainable that could only be pursued by increasing repression	They do bear responsibility.	3
it is reasonable to argue that given what they went through, as the closest they can get to the people who perpetrated this is the British state, indeed the state benefitted from colonialism in a variety of ways, it's reasonable that they should seek recompense from the British state	There are problems in the education system, problems of underperformance, problems in the employment market	3
JA has heard lots of judgments of people being found guilty of uttering racially offensive remarks without themselves being what JA would call a card carrying racist	that's not correct	3
The judiciary have ruled they have the right to make this case	that isn't a source of injustice	3
It's racism	when you classify people as terrorists then you are seeking to dehumanise them	3
we cannot for legal reasons go into sort of identifying individuals	The reason we need these case assist because of that ambiguity	3
they are effectively trying to hand over to some kind of stable rule	we are not prosecuting crimes that were committed against these unfortunate people	3
they suffered in the context of imprisonment possibly	the colonial context is absent	3
it is a good point Clifford makes	they have the opportunity now to try to seek justice	3
CL personally as an English person feelS ashamed about the way the British behaved in these circumstances in Africa at that time	it was in fact typical	3
there are many other survivors who do not currently have access to justice	it is imbued with geography, history and culture	3
we cannot for legal reasons go into sort of identifying individuals	Not to be in a funk when you are reading intelligence reports which suggest your Empire is under sustained assault	3
that isn't a source of injustice	The trains ran on crime	3
The judiciary have ruled they have the right to make this case	you have to draw lines	3
those liabilities actually transferred back to the British Government	it would be totally different if the survivors had all died	3
That's what drove it	there was horror at Mau Mau.	3
we are quite hung up about this	and therefore the only way forward was for Britain to withdraw	3
There is a problem with judging the past by our values	the way they suffered was a crime	3
it will be an important opportunity for the individuals to make their case	We have to go to the roots of this problem	3
The Empire brought a lot of good things	they did what they had to do in order to maintain a liberation struggle	3
The are other instances that bring up questions about imperial rule	Esther would look at the context	3
what was interesting tonight is when you hear Lawrence James who was the second witness	they have nowhere to go	3
the wider context is the colonial dispossession	Esther was also giving wider views around the importance of this case	3
There is a problem with judging the past by our values	That's racially offensive	3
they should be tried	key thing in British society is the horror at the violence of the Mau Mau which is profoundly shocking	3
bad things done under the Empire were an aberration	we would say freedom fighters	3
the wider context is the colonial dispossession	it's not racism	3
we cannot for legal reasons go into sort of identifying individuals	By the 50s, the Empire is going	3
Under the national curriculum, we were told the Empire was bad.	That's racially offensive	3
it's a symbolic case, to open a wider door	You do get reparations in Germany	3
MP raises an interesting point	By the 50s, the Empire is going	3
That's what drove it	in contrast to, say, America, you don't have a kind of polarisation between black and white here in the way that you do there.	3

that's MT's opinion	decided that this had taught an important lesson that the only way in which the British presence in Africa could be sustained was brutality	3
they take us to questions we have still got to resolve.	They can be racially offensive	3
it's a situation where, six years before the start of the Kenya emergency, the British Army in India is being hammered by the nationalists and the Muslims	the context for the atrocities having been carried out by agents of the British Government at the time, the context was the atrocities being carried out against them by the Mau Mau	3
MP raises an interesting point	that's the great difference between the Empire and Nazism	3
we're criticising the fireman	we have to look at it in that way	3
Margaret Thatcher's daughter made some inappropriate comments	there's nothing wrong with this	3
There are problems in the education system, problems of underperformance, problems in the employment market	the country was responsible for what happened in a way that Britain is not responsible, collectively, in the same way, for what happened to these people.	3
that would not be the British Government's view	it is actually very significant	3
these judgments are very difficult to make	the Jewish community was shipped to Auschwitz	3
JA wants a moment that would produce more inclusivity	they represent a class of people	3
bad things done under the Empire were an aberration	it was an unjust war that was being levelled against the Africans	3
MT didn't learn that in school, 40 years ago	Britain is non-inclusive	3
when news first came of the horrific massacre of Mau Mau prisoners in Kenya. Wide swathes of British public opinion and the media and the Prime Minister and most of the Cabinet were horrified and disgusted then, not now, then	that's a hang up Britain has got	3
Lawrence James wants to muddy the waters	It is / is not JA's view that the history of colonialism, maybe the history of slavery, is responsible for racism in Britain	3
JA does not think this particular court case might provide this Mdeba moment	theres' nothing wrong with doing the British thing, owning up and paying up	3
it will be an important opportunity for the individuals to make their case	we do look back to the fact that people were making stirring speeches about it at the time	3
it very much depends which side you take it,	it was a label that was very loaded	3
The Empire brought a lot of good things	the current government of today should be held liable	3
In a sentence, JA thinks / does not think this particular court case might provide this Mdeba moment	black people can't be racist in the United Kingdom context	3

decided that this had taught an important lesson that the only way in which the British presence in Africa could be sustained was brutality	Under the national curriculum, we were told the Empire was bad.	3
it is a very partial view	You have a specific perpetrator	3
in the context of what we're talking about tonight the strange phenomenon then occurred, where the British went in denial and have been in denial ever since.	there's no statute of limitations for murder	3
we are forced to do the analysis	Margaret Thatcher's daughter made some inappropriate comments	3
It seems to be a mixture of arrogance and absurdity	you are on the side of the nationalist movements which replaced the British Empire	3
those liabilities actually transferred back to the British Government	Esther would look at the context	3
it was a label that was very loaded	in almost any jurisdiction in the world it would be seen as a crime	3
atrocities should be - war crimes or atrocities perpetrated against civilians should be - justice should be done regardless of limit of time	the way they suffered was a crime	3
atrocities should be - war crimes or atrocities perpetrated against civilians should be - justice should be done regardless of limit of time	the guilt must be on the side of the colonial power	3
it very much depends which side you take it,	in terms of the case of these individuals they have a perfect right to pursue the claim that they are making and it is reasonable for the British state, even though today's politicians weren't implicated in this, for the British state to be answerable of the actions of the British state in the past, in this specific case	3
That's a caricature	ES has just muddled up civil and criminal cases	3
they have nowhere to go	you are stretching your definition in order to make the British Empire fit into that?	3
there's no statute of limitations for murder	it doesn't really answer why there was such outrage about it	3

it would be totally different if the survivors had all died	there was horror at Mau Mau.	3
that probably isn't enough for JA	This was a war of liberation	3
some of us would argue the case doesn't go far enough	The key point about the British Empire is not necessarily that brutality does not happen but when it does	3
the situation in Kenya was a bloody dirty war	there are survivors, who have never experienced any form of recompense	3
JA does not think this particular court case might provide this Mdeba moment	people who are powerless cannot be prejudiced	3
it is actually very significant	this is a live debate	3
they do need to be compensated for the crimes that were committed against them	it will be an important opportunity for the individuals to make their case	3
it doesn't really answer why there was such outrage about it	it is imbued with geography, history and culture	3
there are not very specific perpetrators	it very much depends which side you take it,	3
we don't have the perpetrators in court	whilst the African Americans are socially segregated from their American cousins, they are economically integrated	3
