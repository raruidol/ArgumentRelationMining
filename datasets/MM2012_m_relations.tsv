Dutch bankers have to take an oath	I gather Dutch bankers don’t just have rules and regulations	0
what they declare is the following: they start their oath with saying “I declare that I will perform my duties as a banker with integrity and care, and I will consider carefully all the interests involved in the bank.

the big issue here is where the boundary should lie between the family and the State; how much the State should be allowed to, interfere is value laden, intervene.	there should be a careful balancing act of freedom.	0

if you would like to consider the concept of non domination, freedom as non domination – the non interference on arbitrary grounds in people’s important decisions – then we have to be careful that when we do intervene it’s to increase total non domination.

I would give, as one example of an organisation that’s changed, the BBC actually, which now tends to be pretty truthful even if only because it wasn’t in the past.	I believe this is capable of reform if we introduce codes, if we stigmatise bad behaviour, if we set about within organisations making sure the codes are adhered to.	0
They don’t explain what ethical behaviour is,	I think the interesting thing is that banks do have codes of ethics, but to the extent they have them they are incredibly disappointing, if not total crap.	0

If somebody’s not willing to reward you by borrowing your savings, there’s no point doing the saving.	it’s, as it were, intellectually honest to kind of play out the virtues of saving, as opposed to borrowing, when really, unless the two kind of balance out in an economy, there’s no point saving	0

the investment banks because the global economy is big. If you want to cut the investment banking industry down to size, slash the global economy – it’s not a terribly great idea.	Barclay's is an institution that can't carry on.	1

Investment banks have to become environments where the risk, all the risk, falls on the people within the institutions.

as we saw from the emails in the Barclays, the acknowledgement people in Barclays were getting, was they were getting acknowledgement from their colleagues for their bad behaviour	Unfortunately I just don’t think we can get away from the inherent complexity here, which is that rules can sometimes be good things and they can sometimes be bad things, but so can social norms	0

what’s really important is that we try and ask people, say on benefits, to start making the same decisions that we expect the people in work have to make	for the State to start telling people whether or not they should have children, however tempting it might be in any individual case, is a very, very dangerous slippery slope	1

There’s no discipline there	if you want the moral hazard, instead of kind of just going on about the bankers, there is a danger that if we just said we’d write off debt, that it actually isn’t very helpful for our side, for ordinary people, to actually have that	0
It is the case that some of the greatest examples of social progress over the years have come from well-off rich people, banks and so on, investing productively	there’s a danger when you kind of say, “The poor are the ones who suffer. The rich are the bad guys.”	0
the problem is that the only thing the banks have done is kind of consumer credit	They should actually be taking more risk and giving more money out	0

it seems entirely unclear	Claire is nervous	0
there’s certain people you just say, “You shouldn’t have children, you’re not fit to have children”	There is a kind of weeding out unfit parents	0
People talk about abuse at the same time as talking about getting kids to school on time, at the same time as talking about them not eating the right kind of food and not reading to their kids	it seems entirely unclear	0
That seems to be the danger	Claire doesn't want a State – or Helen, to have a kind of normative view of what good parenting is	0
that is really important	we must get back to who these families are and why they are so  dysfunctional	0
it’s not a role of social workers, or any other person, to say that “You should be capped at number 3.”	as part of that programme, Helen would say that Helen does have a remit to ask parents to consider what having another child would mean for them, and to get them to consider the opportunities for contraception	0

there is a very tiny minority of families that fall into that situation	Anne and Ruth agree that there are some troubled families	2
Ruth is not in those cases wholly opposed to family intervention programmes	Ruth would do xxx about it	2
It was a state mechanism to compensate for that, that we have this	whatever about papering over the cracks of inequality, it certainly was papering over the weakness of the productive economy	0
Simply	xxx is how we deal with the fact that so many people now do seem to assume that they can have something for nothing	2

There are a number of people competing for work	they’ve never had it	3
Generally investment banking reflects business and commerce as a whole.	They didn’t connect the two things, and the point is not to defend all forms of deference, but there is a sense in which, we used to defer to symbolic authority.	3

the issue is not one of poverty and resources	there is no statute of limitations	3
If we don’t give more benefits, more welfare, we’re going to end up with homeless young people everywhere, destitution and so on	it doesn't really answer why there was such outrage about it	3

If you’re going to work very hard for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and you’re going to make only £1 more than you would have made on benefits the urge to get a job is not as strong as it would be if you’d otherwise be penniless	a young person decides to take out a mortgage, which is taking out a massive debt, so that they don’t have to be dependent on their parents, or don’t have to be maybe dependent on a council house. It’s a sign of independence.	3
people who grow up in very difficult families don’t run a risk of being difficult themselves	it’s judgemental	3

JB didn't say he wants to get rid of the welfare state, the welfare system	I do not believe in free, free, free market Capitalism, as if there’s absolutely no regulation whatsoever.	3
they’re not just playing with their own money	they’ve over broadened their remit over recent years	3
the problem is that welfarism has gone far beyond a safety net, or anything compassionate	you’d not use that argument to explain the reason, for example, why we have an increase in obesity, and claim that the supermarkets are exploiting people’s desire for food	3
that undermines the whole argument that you make about incentives	The other is to say, “Morality is a form of human flourishing, which requires transformation of social conditions.”	3
it is a claim for compensation against the present government, which had no responsibility for what happened	the wider context is the colonial dispossession	3
if they're virtues, that implies that the opposite of thrift and prudence is immoral	not all debt is bad	3
most people put more effort into choosing the coffee shop that they buy their coffee from than which bank they put their life savings in	It creates a dependency on work	3
when people try to make a distinction between the deserving and the less deserving claimants, some people then kick up about it	Without these things it doesn’t function.	3
everyone, from the ancients to kind of most world religions, see thrift and prudence as virtues because xxx	It was their avoidance of being democrats and trying to win us politically	3
It is the case that some of the greatest examples of social progress over the years have come from well-off rich people, banks and so on, investing productively	the fundamental message of consumer capitalism is one which says, “Forget deferred gratification. Forget endeavour. Buy it now.”	3
to make it insist on much more neutrality	If the market doesn’t, for whatever reason never mind who’s fault it is, then the next thing that the government should do, is to provide jobs for these people to do	3
It’s no excuse	This is not all morally blameworthy	3
the current government of today should be held liable	You talk about greed; people are indeed very angry about large bankers bonuses.	3
when ND comes up with this line about sub-prime debt, that this was economic policy, to push loans onto people who couldn’t afford them, the people actually accepting those loans have / have no personal responsibility of their own	what they declare is the following: they start their oath with saying “I declare that I will perform my duties as a banker with integrity and care, and I will consider carefully all the interests involved in the bank. The clients, the shareholders, the employees and the society in which the bank operates, and then there are five or six lines that continue	3
it is / is not right in its strategy for tackling it	the right to intervene is around well being of children	3
it all changed when xxx	if you put money into a building society, that would be on the basis that other people were taking the money out of the building society, to buy a house for example	3
Enoch Powell acknowledged the maltreatment of the Mau Mau in a stirring speech	these are elderly victims	3
it’s difficult for savers to take the high moral ground	there’s some political rhetoric flying around that CG would not choose to be using.	3
the cost of bank borrowing doesn’t rise as the bank gets riskier	it wants to get people in those households into school, into work, out of crime. Changing the patterns of, sometimes, a lifetime	3
If we live in a society where you get kudos for having just a whole lot of money, then people will pursue that	savers have lost out	3
CG's taking the first notion of what morality is	my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	3
savers need saving because xxx	Acknowledgment, in a Christian sense	3
the Christian faith like the Islamic faith has an account of the way these things should be socially organised	If you’re staying on your mates coach and all the rest of it, and you get a job, you want to prove that you’re going to not just kind of go “Oh well, it’s not that much money.” You’ll use it, that’s what you want.	3
the fireman has used too much water to quench the fire	in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	3
it’s these broader circumstances that we really need to get to the nub of	They go up, they go down	3
and it’s fundamentally immoral	SR would never dream of saying that	3
the conditions under which people live aren’t conducive to moral flourishing, and therefore what you want to do is challenge those conditions, change them	Dutch bankers have to take an oath	3
MT has got to look at the underlying economic incentives	that gives it its specific meaning	3
CF is worried about this debate leading to the pathologising of feckless behaviour by individuals, rather than a more balanced discussion.	we’re in a position now where there isn’t enough housing, and where actually some of the parents suggest if you’re agoraphobic you can’t go out to pay rent.	3
they are surely to be presumed to be capable of being helped in a way that allows them to live independent lives.	the country was responsible for what happened in a way that Britain is not responsible, collectively, in the same way, for what happened to these people.	3
it’s / it's not a very important thing to do	This is a huge opportunity that we’ve barely begun to explore in the UK system	3
we lack both reciprocity and teleology	some people are not working because they can make a penny more from giving up their job and living at home	3
they can afford to sort it out themselves	That would be a baseline, that children are actually safe	3
the right to intervene is around well being of children	there is an outstanding crime that has been committed	3
it is a reasonable thing for the state to intervene in those cases	Anne tried to push AB on that	3
since this government’s come to power they’ve tried to exploit tensions in working class Britain between the working poor and the unemployed; between the non-disabled and the disabled; between private sector workers and public sector workers	we have to starve people	3
Many people would raise their eyebrows at the idea that investment banks are successful in terms of managing risks.	You have a specific perpetrator	3
people have / do not have to have that	it seems to be odd that JW talks about culture so much, and doesn’t refer to the cultural norms that are created by the dominance of those models	3
you can’t separate morals from practice	MB's been reviewing it.	3
the fact is, if living standards aren’t going up what you do is you let people borrow money	You would think that you were imposing a kind of domination on your neighbors if you were just behaving very badly, and making everybody’s lives a misery around you	3
These are children  on the threshold of being taken away to live in care	It’s meant to make a difference	3
it’s not particularly attractive	there has not been a transfer	3
MB's been reviewing it.	that’s a distinction that we’ve somehow lost	3
xxx is how we move from a policy that we’ve been pursuing for quite a long time, of trying to fight poverty mainly by giving people more in cash benefits, which solves the problem today, to a policy which is more about solving the problem over the long run by moving more people into work, reducing unemployment	Melanie doesn’t want to get bogged down into a discussion about a figure	3
we’re talking here about families with children	there are 5 million people on the waiting list for social housing	3
it is a claim for compensation against the present government, which had no responsibility for what happened	You are just scapegoating an entire bunch of people, the vast majority of whom one has no reason to believe do anything other than behave with honesty and integrity.	3
So these factors matter.	the figures are not a moral issue	3
If Melanie's pointing to the phenomena of multiple or clustered disadvantage, if  Alexander were going to name one form of disadvantage as the key determiner it would be poverty, not lack of marriage	SR should not be so worried about restoring stigma	3
Esther is being selective about her context	most people put more effort into choosing the coffee shop that they buy their coffee from than which bank they put their life savings in	3
First witness made a very practical case about what’s happened if you’ve got savings	Anne and Ruth agree that there are some troubled families	3
credit raises living standards	the lenders are actually the banks, that are at the pinnacle of our society	3
It’s a bit like saying wearing a jumper is moral	angels are very difficult to select, but it has to start at the top	3
problem families are problem families because they cause problems/ they face problems	the current government of today should be held liable	3
No parent in the family is in work;	we cannot take away the fact that these were people who were simply fighting to reclaim their lost lands	3
Then that leads to poverty, and not to mention family breakdown.	there are many families bringing up children without fathers very well.	3
they need help getting back on track	First witness made a very practical case about what’s happened if you’ve got savings	3
Barclay's is an institution that can't carry on.	In most other countries there’s something like an unemployment insurance	3
that is not irresponsible	the history of the financial services industry demonstrates that this is an industry with a deep commitment to exploiting those weaknesses, in order to make a fast buck	3
JL's industry should simply be ethical	There is no problem  here.	3
I think that if you look at trust in the banking sector, we’ve seen that it’s been declining to very low levels	there is a deep moral instinct which says that the whole business of lending and borrowing is a highly moral area, or, if you like, a dangerous moral area	3
they are somehow or another demoralized and broken	what’s really important is that we try and ask people, say on benefits, to start making the same decisions that we expect the people in work have to make	3
they think that the only way they can win the hearts and minds of the demos [0:40:06], which has not been true economically, is to buy us off with a sub-prime mortgage and a cheap sofa.	child tax credit is just like a much more generous version of child benefit	3
Some regulation might help	the State is subsidising employers who refuse to pay people decent wages	3
if you get into debt, and you can never get out of it, that’s slavery	It didn’t flow into those industrial activities	3
the problem we always have with debt, which SR would use rather than credit, is that ultimately there is interest.	there are people who save	3
here you don't have specific perpetrators.	I think the relics of colonialism, racism and the current dystopia around in relation to people groping focus a kind of inclusive British citizenship that relieves them of the guilt of their - of the past, and opens up a vista of an inclusive future, actually relies on, to some extent, Britain having a truth and reconciliation moment,	3
we’re talking about the general sort of, philosophical underpinning of this.	Otherwise you’ve got slavery.	3
we have to bribe people	the fireman has used too much water to quench the fire	3
xxx is what JB will do	If you took the people around this table this evening, and you took away all of our contacts, our qualifications our great jobs and so on, we’d still have more internal resources than that guy	3
Housing benefit has not a debilitating ?effect	there seemed to be a germ of compassion about what Neil was saying	3
they do need help	you do actually want to say, “Money doesn’t grow on trees.”	3
it’s almost as though people won’t take account of the fact they’ve got absolutely no money	that’s within a much wider social context, wherein those individual decisions are mediated	3
that was a label that was given to them	we have a huge problem with unemployment	3
there’s parents with mental health problems who have lost their ability to care for their children	there is such a lot of evidence that it does have a distorting effect	3
Housing benefit has not a debilitating ?effect	CF was trying to cross-examine the first witness, but she actually seemed to be quite concerned about some of the things coming out of the Government	3
It’s a virtue	There are many families, and Louise Casey has this in mind, where for a variety of reasons a lone mother – and it’s usually a lone mother – cannot look after her children properly, doesn’t know how to very often	3
this actually has a fine tradition elsewhere	Nothing good happened under Nazism	3
There used to be codes operating, professional associations used to discipline people much more clearly	if you borrowed £200 from me, and in 30 days time you pay back £250, the interest rate on that is 1,413.01%	3
if one says that poverty is the cause then someone like RL is dooming these people to live in serial disadvantage and pass it down to their children. Which is what RL's side of the argument has done over several decades	that is not going to make young black Britons feel better	3
MB's been reviewing it.	Family lives in overcrowded housing	3
there is an internal failure in some cases	It creates a dependency on work	3
we are getting to the point where debt is simply going out of control	as a society we had created a set of social norms and values which protected us from our innate short-termism	3
this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	SR is shying away from stigma	3
We don’t allow fatty products to say they're healthy	xxx is who suffers most from the lack of moral hazard, the perceived lack of moral hazard	3
So these factors matter.	It doesn’t expect that if you have a false set of structures, or a false set of purposes, that everything will be fine if you just have very good individuals	3
We don't look at it halfway through	there are lots of ways in which you can hopefully allow the market to create jobs	3
they should just get on the bus to Cardiff	everything can just carry on	3
individual faith is not strong enough	It seems to be a mixture of arrogance and absurdity	3
that’s the distinction	These are children  on the threshold of being taken away to live in care	3
most people put more effort into choosing the coffee shop that they buy their coffee from than which bank they put their life savings in	Some regulation might help	3
anyone’s saying it should be two, or three, and that’s the limit	poverty is the cause of multiple disadvantage/ poverty is the result of multiple disadvantage	3
It’s not coercive at all	some of the world is suffering from the impact of development on climate change, for example.	3
it speaks well for the case that is being brought at the moment	it is not	3
these are elderly victims	there’s certainly an argument to look at re-introducing a contributory principle back in to welfare. Something like the French system where if you lose your job you get 70% of your previous wage for a limited period	3
The reason we have so many people claiming housing benefit is because there isn’t the social housing	in order to finance the trade and the extraction of resource in African countries, infrastructure was built and there was a degree of benevolence	3
There used to be codes operating, professional associations used to discipline people much more clearly	No, no. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with people making a profit	3
there are too many people included in those categories	there is a natural and normal desire to work	3
Helen would take, and Family Action, a much broader view about who troubled families actually are	‘The Daily Telegraph’ pointed out there are 23 people chasing every job in this country	3
they did what they had to do in order to maintain a liberation struggle	They are left absolutely high and dry,	3
it means that we are forced to engage in this conversation	society benefits/ society suffers	3
there is a very tiny minority of families that fall into that situation	Lawrence James wants to muddy the waters	3
it’s (to get in debt) quite morally neutral.	she was helping them manage their resources.	3
it’s (to get in debt) quite morally neutral.	to make it insist on much more neutrality	3
these companies, in their marketing departments, sit down and say to themselves, “When we’re advertising our products, we should make sure that consumers really, really, really understand what they’re getting in for”?  / they sit down and think, “How can we get customers to buy our products, by putting in the shop window the most generous possible figures in the hope that they won’t understand that that’s just an offer to lure them in”?	it seems to be odd that JW talks about culture so much, and doesn’t refer to the cultural norms that are created by the dominance of those models	3
the present government of Britain should be held responsible for responsibility for the these atrocities of its predecessor administration many decades ago	They can't go back and dig up Macmillan	3
it was like living on thin air	xxx is how in a different system the poor would not get the blame and is how they would not come off worse	3
The origin of the word ‘credit’ is the Latin ‘Credere’ – to believe.	xxx is the template the Government is seeking to replicate	3
you could say that at the moment one of the problems is that there’s not enough credit being released creatively	If you look at these things, as anyone in work would look at, if you can’t afford to have children the State should not step in and say “Unconditionally, we will support you if you make the decision to have children you can’t afford”	3
the initiative is ‘troubled families’, not ‘troublesome families’.	nothing horrible was done under the Empire	3
we need to encourage young people to see a third way, an alternative to that	Over a million people, young people, without work, it has a scarring impact	3
There’s no discipline there	MB could see First witness and CF kind of veering	3
it's not only the right to a job that RS'd accept	I want to live in a London that doesn’t have high levels of homelessness	3
it’s to do with credit liberalisation in the United States.	that is not going to make young black Britons feel better	3
In JB's ‘non-utopia’ where he's abolished the welfare state, xxx is what happens to those 2 million	Some regulation might help	3
there are lots of ways in which we can change our welfare state to make it better	the push is coming from the people with the money	3
That worries CL very much	there's a streak that says, it was a pretty balanced account, there's nothing wrong with colonialism	3
The difference is that this was an aberration	this was compensation for the fact that actually there was sluggish, slow, productive growth, that was then sold somehow as, “Well yes, but everything’s okay because we’ll fuel a consumer cross talking [0:38:41].”	3
it takes a very simple view	it is a reasonable thing for the state to intervene in those cases	3
it’s quite striking that all three witnesses, coming from very different positions, put their finger on that	that’s sometimes related not being in work	3
That would be a baseline, that children are actually safe	it’s obvious	3
investment banks that have highly public ethical problems don’t lose their clients.	Giles thinks that the banking industry, the City of London and Capitalism are upsetting and immoral.	3
the old idea of welfarism as a safety net, has changed	thrift is a perfectly sensible thing to do	3
it’s to do with credit liberalisation in the United States.	JB didn’t refer to utopia	3
it is also very much a trap	while we’re bringing the issue of Socialist based arguments in this forum, Alexander would also question the role of market principles in some of the provision of social services here	3
The reason that the number of people on benefits has soared, is simply because the jobs that once existed disappeared	AM wasn't remotely convinced by Lee Jasper's argument that this would help black Britons today	3
It is a safety net	It was a state mechanism to compensate for that, that we have this	3
the main conversation is, “How do we do compliant adverts?”	If you have exemplars	3
AM doesn't quite understand what RS's real criticism is of what Mr Cameron was saying	you would accept your non domination theory would fall if you were intervening for the good of those around them as well respecting their rights to be non dominated.	3
there are many other survivors who do not currently have access to justice	that majority includes / does not include CL	3
That’s the difference	It’s often kind of guilt money coming out	3
that’s not necessarily how the welfare state was ever intended to work, or the way it does work	what’s happening in the industrial revolution we’re experiencing at the moment, is precisely that 70% of the world is benefitting from it. Whereas the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century was confined to Europe and North America.	3
It can be a way of demonstrating independence	it was an unjust war that was being levelled against the Africans	3
there is this sort of sense amongst a lot of young people, who just think, “I want that, so I’ll have that now. Thank you.”	Cameron’s concerns resonate with perhaps the majority	3
Ethics relies upon, in some sense, hierarchy; some hierarchical authority, and in some sense a social purpose. But actually, neither of those things exist in investment banks	the conditions under which people live aren’t conducive to moral flourishing, and therefore what you want to do is challenge those conditions, change them	3
And the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items.	What we need to do to deal with poverty is to do something about the 2 million children who live in poverty	3
there is something in it	They’ve basically not been fated by that	3
that presupposes a God, or at least a recording angel to see our misdeeds when we commit them.	people or nations have responsibility for what they borrow	3
That’s got nothing to do with poverty,	MT overestimates the role of ideas in these matters	3
the trouble with both Kantian and utilitarian morality is it only happens sometimes, we need to get back to the classics.	It's a specific case	3
they should really be angry with their government for not addressing the underlying social policy issues	there was horror at Mau Mau.	3
JL's industry should simply be ethical	there are chaotic families that place an unreasonable burden on the State	3
It’s been done to them, not done by them	a Liberal society has an absolute moral duty to go and help those people, especially the child	3
Owen has answered Anne's question	there are not very specific perpetrators	3
we shouldn’t be too optimistic there that we can develop regulation that makes banks change their cultures	this actually has a fine tradition elsewhere	3
there’s been 100 billion pounds transfer from savers to borrowers	they don't have a sense of entitlement from the state rather than a sense of self-reliance	3
that presupposes a God, or at least a recording angel to see our misdeeds when we commit them.	families have low income	3
there’s certainly an argument to look at re-introducing a contributory principle back in to welfare. Something like the French system where if you lose your job you get 70% of your previous wage for a limited period	‘The Daily Telegraph’ pointed out there are 23 people chasing every job in this country	3
there is/ is not a moral distinction between the two	whilst the African Americans are socially segregated from their American cousins, they are economically integrated	3
they’re descending personally into financial chaos	There are three people who it seems very likely suffered	3
What is wrong with what she is doing is that she is presenting that tiny minority of troubled families as typical of the poor	They do bear responsibility.	3
Nothing good happened under Nazism	one of the problems we’re facing now is the fact that organisations, and indeed people who require debt, that what we’re doing is rolling everything over	3
the Government is / is not right in its definition of the problem	it takes a very simple view	3
we all know people who will tell you about some terribly wretched childhood that they’ve had	It’s actually rather immoral to come up with this kind of structurally derived argument that says, “Your job is really – or our job, collectively – is just to say to people ‘we will not put up with these situations and encourage political action’”.	3
it should be about a bit of both	I do not believe in free, free, free market Capitalism, as if there’s absolutely no regulation whatsoever.	3
it's not a very important thing to do	that gives it its specific meaning	3
It doesn't presuppose a God	JB blames the political system that has created a trap for these people	3
he didn't half did	the colonial context is absent	3
That is the essentially unjust element in this whole transaction	If one lot of people is going to give another lot of people money, that second lot of people should be willing to work, and should work.	3
we shouldn’t be too optimistic there that we can develop regulation that makes banks change their cultures	if one says that poverty is the cause then someone like RL is dooming these people to live in serial disadvantage and pass it down to their children. Which is what RL's side of the argument has done over several decades	3
It didn’t flow into those industrial activities	the wrong investments are made	3
it can if they can get it to the people who need it	What JL's financing is the ability of people to smooth out the peaks and troughs of their income and expenditure	3
that’s sometimes related not being in work,	MT was told it was generally speaking a good thing	3
it is Helen's view that what we have here is a group of people who can’t impose moral standards on their own lives, and need help to impose those standards on their lives	the violence that the Mau Mau perpetrated against settlers and particularly loyal Africans xxx	3
When you see these cases, there is still a strong feeling of saying, it wasn't so bad after all	Nothing good happened under Nazism	3
It’s been done to them, not done by them	What is wrong with what she is doing is that she is presenting that tiny minority of troubled families as typical of the poor	3
there's a streak that says, it was a pretty balanced account, there's nothing wrong with colonialism	It should try to be as neutral as possible between those, except in cases such that people’s chosen morality prevents other people from living their lives.	3
they make more money out of it	debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt	3
The way Neil would describe a lot of the people Neil's met who have been long term unemployed is kind of defeated, kind of depressed	Claire's trying to just avoid saying that saving is moral	3
the idea of ‘the’ problem family is a useful invention that’s been used again and again to police the poor, and to place the blame for social problems on individuals	there should be a window of apology and getting back to common sense.	3
Britain is actually very unusual compared to other countries	If they’re going to be of working age, able bodied, and if they’re going to get benefits; they should not be allowed just to sit at home on benefits	3
Claire wants to encourage a society that treats people as grown ups; that allows them to grow up	That's a caricature	3
therefore [you are going to provide money to these people	that is something that we don’t read in the newspapers every day	3
It’s not about bad apples, that always seems to be a bit of a distraction that you just focus on a few individuals.	what it requires is that at the top of an organisation, there are angels in a certain sense	3
the Government seems to be targeting only the poor for intervention	CL personally as an English person feelS ashamed about the way the British behaved in these circumstances in Africa at that time	3
Human beings are not very good at the long-term	this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	3
There is a problem with judging the past by our values	it is true	3
They get nothing out of it	you’ve got to be careful.	3
the free market system itself is based up on a very individualistic anthropology	anyone’s saying it should be two, or three, and that’s the limit	3
it is a reasonable thing for the state to intervene in those cases	it’s the poor who suffer	3
It’s not that CF wants to let people off the hook	a carrot and a stick approach to welfare state won't actually solve them	3
there were atrocities on both sides, including in this big group of people that Esther has just referred to	that’s not necessarily how the welfare state was ever intended to work, or the way it does work	3
it was something like 16% of sub-prime borrowers didn’t even make a first payment	the old idea of welfarism as a safety net, has changed	3
The basis of Capitalism is actually that it requires belief and trust and credit.	we have to change the nature of the financial system and the economy	3
they were treated in an appalling way	it was a struggle of liberation	3
we need to encourage young people to see a third way, an alternative to that	borrowing can be a wise choice for individuals	3
there were crimes against humanity	That’s a very sort of, cost/benefit analysis approach to social policy and family life	3
people who grow up in very difficult families don’t run a risk of being difficult themselves	there’s some very virtuous people who work in the City of London and do extraordinarily good things with their money.	3
it was a freedom struggle	the urge to get a job is overwhelming	3
a country can even say, “We’re going to go bankrupt. It’s humiliating. We’ll do it. We’ll start again. We’ll grow	this means nothing	3
there is very great danger here of stirring up resentment towards people who need welfare to keep house and home together	I think the interesting thing is that banks do have codes of ethics, but to the extent they have them they are incredibly disappointing, if not total crap.	3
that is fair	there is a distorting effect on whether you’re prepared to go into training, whether you will go back in to the labour market; on what terms you’re prepared to take a job	3
their particular problems were entirely resultant of the circumstances in which they found themselves	there is not a danger that we’ll actually make things worse	3
the State has a duty to intervene / it is  wrong to intervene	Whether it means interfering in those families being able to conduct a flourishing life; whether it’s intervening in their property, in their bodily integrity; in their mental wellbeing by continuous harassment or nuisance.	3
We’re pretending the problem isn’t there	Many people would raise their eyebrows at the idea that investment banks are successful in terms of managing risks.	3
What is going on here is xxx	CF hasn’t tried it yet,	3
What is going on here is xxx	the young guy’d lost his job at Tesco	3
it was an unjust war that was being levelled against the Africans	which is the supreme example of just that individualism and abstraction	3
it is far better, a better form of intervention, to provide decent jobs and decent wages, affordable housing	they had to be over-hauled because xxx	3
what we had was a whiff of class war, and a lot of moral displacement	MP and RL’re talking here about poor people being moral agents,	3
Claire's no evidence for Claire's assertions	that is a case of some paternalism	3
poverty is the cause of multiple disadvantage/ poverty is the result of multiple disadvantage	they have the opportunity now to try to seek justice	3
It does work up to a point insofar that the introduction of tax credits did move some groups, particularly lone parents, that helped to get more of them into employment	we lack both reciprocity and teleology	3
AM had a problem with both of the big ‘isms’ in this argument.	AB talks about neutrality as a principle	3
that it’s not the job of Government to favour or privilege any one moral view.	If we want to live in a Liberal society that is also tolerant, we must have a set of principles that we all digest and understand, that ground and explain, and justify why we behave as we do	3
they have lost their ability to do that	MT overestimates that	3
morally,Ruth has / has not any objection to this intervention	I want to live in a London that doesn’t have high levels of homelessness	3
you do have to have certain rudiments of knowledge about yourself, about structures, and how you live with other people.	The State can provide information, guidance, and assistance on a voluntary basis.	3
Think about Bill Gates and all the wonderful things that his money is doing.	People have survived that for centuries	3
In a sense he’s very similar to the abolition of the Board and Lodgings Allowance that Margaret Thatcher brought in at the end of the ‘80s, which obviously saw a huge spike in rough sleeping	it's the British thing of legally examining it, and rationally going through the evidence and finding complete proof, total proof that these people suffered injuries in such a place in such a way, and that the officers who commanded them, then the judges and the lawyers can say how far are these agents of the British state	3
It's not a question of the British thing	That is the source of the subsidy in the lending world, in banking	3
it’s part of an industrial strategy for them to do that	That means not simply looking at the individual, but to change the conditions and provide those sorts of conditions.	3
it clearly shows that Cameron hasn’t learnt any lesson from the past	Helen seems to take the first way of looking at this	3
the discourse around this that we’ve had, with some of these very hysterical comments from Louise Casey and the Government, are not acceptable	there’s two questions here	3
the initiative is ‘troubled families’, not ‘troublesome families’.	therefore [you are going to provide money to these people	3
It’s not incentives	If you didn’t have investment banking, you’d have to recreate it.	3
a number of these families exist who do cause problems to the children who grow up in them, and the people around them.	the Jewish community was shipped to Auschwitz	3
individual faith, whatever it’s kind – religious faith or secular faith – faith is completely contingent on our social circumstances	Ruth is not in those cases wholly opposed to family intervention programmes	3
the present government of Britain should be held responsible for responsibility for the these atrocities of its predecessor administration many decades ago	people who grow up in very difficult families don’t run a risk of being difficult themselves	3
there is a problem	that plays against Matthew's point	3
James was blaming the system	that does seem to correspond to the reality	3
The pragmatic justification is that they - if they are to take their case against anybody, we, this state, the British state now, is the closest they can get to it.	it creates these disincentives	3
they will only do it if they are regulated	Humans flourish on recognition, social recognition	3
That’s the definition that the Government is using	they are choosing to borrow small amounts of money for short periods of time	3
you start again with some very strict rules and a stigma.	MT overestimates that	3
unemployment is a state out of which everybody could get, if the government didn’t get in the way	Sometimes people just want to have more children, even if they can’t afford them	3
the welfare state system is creating a whole class of work shy, people who are incentivised not to work	people are incentivised to remain unemployed	3
that’s what’s trying to be addressed here.	we have a system dominated not by productive capitalism but by finance capitalism and consumer capitalism	3
the argument that Anne was raising “Let’s not talk about externalities, let’s talk about internalities” as it were, misses the point	you can help them get back on their feet and able to parent their children effectively	3
the present government of Britain should be held responsible for responsibility for the these atrocities of its predecessor administration many decades ago	you say, “You get benefits on the basis that you work.”	3
a lot of bad things were done under the Empire	the problem is that’s been the policy for the last three decades, to encourage huge amounts of borrowing to keep the economy going	3
Cameron has / has not a point	I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	3
families have low income	there’s a danger here that Christian basically cannot see a possibility of breaking this, or people breaking it themselves	3
you have to come up with a moral response to it.	you have to look at personal choices and responsibility, and also the conditions you create around families that lead to those decisions.	3
there is a social responsibility for bringing up children appropriately	Other companies, other organisations, have a sense of mission and also they have bosses who kind of know what’s going on.	3
In JB's ‘non-utopia’ where he's abolished the welfare state, xxx is what happens to those 2 million	the reality is that in the last ten or twenty years there’s been a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, and from the young to the old, and that what Neil's really trying to do is to justify that by blaming the poor for their position	3
JL's industry should not need to be wrapped up in red tape	you say, “You get benefits on the basis that you work.”	3
you get certain ‘social goods’ which are greater than that	‘welfare to work’ creates the opposite of a dependency on welfare state	3
There’s no discipline there	incentives are irrelevant	3
there are many forms of state intervention	rich countries in the West occupying countries of other people and imposing their rule on them and generally speaking extracting various forms of wealth from those countries to benefit the host country	3
who spend their Christmases manning soup kitchens.	bosses don’t really know what’s going on	3
that is that when discussing moral issues, and they have sworn an oath at some point, that the oath can help give them an extra motivation to stay.	Sometimes people just want to have more children, even if they can’t afford them	3
There’s no point saving money in Britain, unless you're already quite rich	JB: did not take adversarial position towards the poor unfortunate people who’ve been trapped in the trap	3
JB does not blame the people-	What we do need to think about, are people’s incentives, and how you set up people’s incentives in the right way, that people do the right things	3
In the old days of early capitalism, bankers were famously prudent people	What is actually happening is that people are choosing to pay down their long-term debt, their credit cards and their bank loans	3
we lack both reciprocity and teleology	that is not so morally wrong	3
This is a huge opportunity that we’ve barely begun to explore in the UK system	Claire's a campaigner for more housing	3
RS's kind of treating them as though they’re passive recipients of something	it doesn't really answer why there was such outrage about it	3
corporations have no souls to damn and no bodies to kick.	families have low income	3
that is a source of injustice	it seems to be odd that JW talks about culture so much, and doesn’t refer to the cultural norms that are created by the dominance of those models	3
that’s not their fault	these terms ‘deserving’ or ‘undeserving’ are not particularly helpful	3
to do that, and to present the problem of poverty as one of dysfunctional families who are antisocial and need to have their behaviour changed, is itself a moral issue	Claire's argued that we should build over green belt	3
the knowledge is bounded	JA wants a moment that would produce more inclusivity	3
in the end it’s culture not faith that might save us	that really is outrageous	3
that argument is even stronger if the people you’re relying on are not your friends and family, but other people you don’t even know	the economy is in such a terrible state that in order to expand the economy, and get us out of this crisis, we have to encourage people to borrow.	3
what the Jubilee Debt Campaign says is that this isn’t simply a matter of individual morality	there are lots of ways in which you can hopefully allow the market to create jobs	3
Claire wants to encourage a society that treats people as grown ups; that allows them to grow up	You take someone like Bob Diamond, in other industries he would have been sent off for two years to run branch banking so he knew more about it, before becoming a group Chief Executive.	3
they enjoy that	There are problems in the education system, problems of underperformance, problems in the employment market	3
buy now, pay later, is the kind of core morality of consumer capitalism	it was the product of a policy that was unsustainable that could only be pursued by increasing repression	3
We kidded ourselves during the last decade that we’d solved the problem of unemployment,	we need to think about, how we have a more paternalist system for people like that	3
it's not brutal enough	they do need help	3
some people have an innate desire, so called, to work harder than others	the situation in Kenya was a bloody dirty war	3
interest rates are being kept really low, in order that borrowers won’t bear the consequences of their foolish borrowing.	we’ve done a lot to improve work incentives financially	3
it is actually very significant	we would say freedom fighters	3
it clearly shows that Cameron hasn’t learnt any lesson from the past	the fundamental message of consumer capitalism is one which says, “Forget deferred gratification. Forget endeavour. Buy it now.”	3
the reality is that in the last ten or twenty years there’s been a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, and from the young to the old, and that what Neil's really trying to do is to justify that by blaming the poor for their position	there’s been a transfer	3
they’ve overcome them	If the market doesn’t, for whatever reason never mind who’s fault it is, then the next thing that the government should do, is to provide jobs for these people to do	3
you’re going to fall back on this individualism and abstraction	there is not a danger that we’ll actually make things worse	3
The problem is that so much debt has been acquired that has gone towards non-productive usage	JB didn’t refer to utopia	3
we had money lenders from one religious persuasion unable to lend to their own persuasion, but happily would lend to those of another religious persuasion	It’s been created by a sense of impunity, of invulnerability	3
abolishing housing benefit for under 25s will lead to staying with your mates	Christian tries to reform families, not individuals	3
it’s not going to have the effect that Cameron believes that it will	MT was told it was generally speaking a good thing	3
Because of the sums of money passing through the investment banks and the markets, they need to have higher standards of care than in other areas.	Claire has an answer to Neil's complaint that the market in housing has seriously distorted the housing benefit	3
the discourse around this that we’ve had, with some of these very hysterical comments from Louise Casey and the Government, are not acceptable	they are the home of continuing morality in some ways	3
Acknowledgment, in a Christian sense	it’s part of an industrial strategy for them to do that	3
they should just get on the bus to Cardiff	Claire has no answer to Neil's complaint that our market in housing has seriously distorted the housing benefit	3
the country was responsible for what happened in a way that Britain is not responsible, collectively, in the same way, for what happened to these people.	that’s very dangerous to the solidarity, which civilization requires	3
there’s the rub	Banking, like so much else, has become deprofessionalised.	3
incentives are irrelevant	it means that we are forced to engage in this conversation	3
there are cases where families are harming themselves and harming others	there’s no chance	3
it's not racism	we lack any sense of the common good	3
That would be a baseline, that children are actually safe	people are taking on too much debt because xxx	3
they're having to rely on others	It may be that it’s a perfectly decent product	3
there are many other survivors who do not currently have access to justice	Christian tries  to reform individuals	3
people who took the sub-prime mortgages were the beneficiaries – and now the sufferers – of a policy	Lawrence James doesn't really like this case	3
they're in debt	people are taking on too much debt because xxx	3
not many people have been driven out of the houses on which they can’t afford to maintain their payments	It’s actually rather immoral to come up with this kind of structurally derived argument that says, “Your job is really – or our job, collectively – is just to say to people ‘we will not put up with these situations and encourage political action’”.	3
Barclay's is an institution that can't carry on.	there are too many people included in those categories	3
The judiciary have ruled they have the right to make this case	it doesn’t do something that also has an impact on everyone.	3
the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items	The consumer credit industry is very highly regulated	3
it needs thoughtful reform to avoid the tendency that it has to trap people in dependency as a way of life	That’s a rather specific example	3
If you have exemplars	this is quite a tricky discussion	3
There is absolute impunity for lenders at that level	MB's been reviewing it.	3
it's a symbolic case, to open a wider door	we can do xxx to make JA happy	3
if one is a Liberal, the principal of neutrality is as good as any other.	there’s two questions here	3
we’re seeing this with the Barclays example	what JL's doing is providing small loans, for short periods of time, to help them smooth out their family income	3
if you look at the figures, fatherlessness, family breakdown, is disproportionately represented in all these social problems. 	people on minimum wage usually have benefits; are usually forced to take on benefits	3
Neil's not trying to justify anything	there's no statute of limitations for murder	3
if you add up all the debt, from all the sectors in the economy, we’re actually having 10 times our annual income	you can be in a situation where you say, “We will let you write off your debts, without incurring moral hazard.”	3
it was quite old legislation	it was a label that was very loaded	3
buy now, pay later, is the kind of core morality of consumer capitalism	you can help them get back on their feet and able to parent their children effectively	3
the knowledge is bounded	individual faith is not strong enough	3
You do get reparations in Germany	we are just providing the work that people want to do	3
we are not prosecuting crimes that were committed against these unfortunate people	Not at all	3
credit advertising is highly regulated	there’s some very virtuous people who work in the City of London and do extraordinarily good things with their money.	3
they should just get on the bus to Cardiff	It’s not beyond the imagination to imagine the young might get up and go and do something about this, other than kind of sit and wait to be handed something.	3
My suspicion is that if you don’t, in some sense, believe in a transcendent good – in other words that there’s an objective good, that there’s an objective goal for human beings	we need to think about how to describe the problem, and understand the problem accurately	3
I think you are simplifying your duality.	we’re seeing this with the Barclays example	3
MP raises an interesting point	she represents justice and the common good	3
we might for instance want banks to split and to ring fence retail banking from high risk investment for instance	their deposits are guaranteed	3
that it’s not the job of Government to favour or privilege any one moral view.	That is interesting	3
if I want a washing machine, I have to go to the launderette every week at the moment and spend several pounds in the launderette	In the same way that in other countries which run well and efficient welfare states, have very low unemployment – much lower than we do – it would be as low, or lower as it is there	3
that hints to the kind of schism around citizenship that we have here in the United Kingdom	we do look back to the fact that people were making stirring speeches about it at the time	3
they're in debt	that hints to the kind of schism around citizenship that we have here in the United Kingdom	3
that argument is even stronger if the people you’re relying on are not your friends and family, but other people you don’t even know	debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt	3
when news first came of the horrific massacre of Mau Mau prisoners in Kenya. Wide swathes of British public opinion and the media and the Prime Minister and most of the Cabinet were horrified and disgusted then, not now, then	as part of that programme, Helen would say that Helen does have a remit to ask parents to consider what having another child would mean for them, and to get them to consider the opportunities for contraception	3
CG is not taking the first notion of what morality is	it very much depends which side you take it,	3
there are about six times more savers than borrowers	you have to follow the rules, and you have to know the rules and you have to have the power to stick to the rules	3
my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	What JL's financing is the ability of people to smooth out the peaks and troughs of their income and expenditure	3
the first witness made some very interesting points	we need to think about, how we have a more paternalist system for people like that	3
they might not find it coercive	In some ways you need that discipline, to be a saver, to think, “I won’t get into debt”	3
CF is not interested in Cameron making cuts	the guilt must be on the side of the colonial power	3
they don't have a sense of entitlement from the state rather than a sense of self-reliance	we do need to get back to this idea of desert	3
thrift is a perfectly sensible thing to do	First witness made a very practical case about what’s happened if you’ve got savings	3
the problems we have is when debt gets out of control.	I think it’s not going to help change the culture	3
her mother was so poorly parented	the Hola circumstances and the shock did not change the public consciousness about ourselves as an imperial power,and realised it was morally unsustainable from then onwards	3
the investment banks because the global economy is big. If you want to cut the investment banking industry down to size, slash the global economy – it’s not a terribly great idea.	credit raises living standards	3
we have to look at it in that way	a high proportion of people are desperate to work, that work on such low wages that they have to have benefits in order to top them up	3
they don’t have the security of future income that they did have before the credit crisis	The key point about the British Empire is not necessarily that brutality does not happen but when it does	3
that has become incredibly dangerous and insupportable	The constant need for government to regulate JL'S industry	3
their particular problems were entirely resultant of the circumstances in which they found themselves	AM is not in the same way	3
That's not what Esther stated	there’s no chance	3
the fundamental message of consumer capitalism is one which says, “Forget deferred gratification. Forget endeavour. Buy it now.”	these things are in some sort of a balance	3
they enjoy that	there were crimes against humanity	3
the figures are not a moral issue	if I want a washing machine, I have to go to the launderette every week at the moment and spend several pounds in the launderette	3
Michael Portillo should lend Michael Buerk a fiver	we have a system dominated not by productive capitalism but by finance capitalism and consumer capitalism	3
the poor are in the most disadvantaged of all positions.	That's not good enough	3
taxpayers are pretty broad based	bosses don’t really know what’s going on	3
Investment Banks are just too dangerous now as environments.	The outside impetus is the equivalent of your spike in the steering wheel, and I think that’s necessary.	3
my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	this is a moral programme	3
JB likens it to a mouse trap which has a rather stale piece of cheese in it	the very existence of these institutions which have so much power	3
It's racism	it’s not neutrality at all	3
JB likens it to a mouse trap which has a rather stale piece of cheese in it	people do not think that	3
angels are very difficult to select, but it has to start at the top	If you want the economy to run smoothly, you have to incentivise certain types of behaviour.	3
I don’t get this concept of systemic	people are still going to investment banks with ethical problems.	3
AM wasn't remotely convinced by Lee Jasper's argument that this would help black Britons today	You do get reparations in Germany	3
there is one caveat	JB likens it to a mouse trap which has a rather stale piece of cheese in it	3
that it is a problem	CF hasn’t tried it yet,	3
there are many forms of state intervention	people should not have to pay their debts	3
that presupposes a God, or at least a recording angel to see our misdeeds when we commit them.	it's a situation where, six years before the start of the Kenya emergency, the British Army in India is being hammered by the nationalists and the Muslims	3
that's the great difference between the Empire and Nazism	if I have a child, I have to consider if I can afford the child	3
if you put money into a building society, that would be on the basis that other people were taking the money out of the building society, to buy a house for example	their particular problems were entirely resultant of the circumstances in which they found themselves	3
it is imbued with geography, history and culture	lending money at interest isn't shameful	3
No that’s not possible, but that’s not something we should try to aim at	CF's got no savings	3
you’re going to fall back on this individualism and abstraction	You’re just basically told you’re not up to it.	3
You’re just basically told you’re not up to it.	you put a pound in	3
If Melanie's pointing to the phenomena of multiple or clustered disadvantage, if  Alexander were going to name one form of disadvantage as the key determiner it would be poverty, not lack of marriage	it’s been pointed out that borrowing money can have disadvantages, as well as advantages	3
Prudent/imprudent, it makes no difference to people lending their money to banks	it’s much more likely	3
we have an excessive amount of lending	the Jewish community was shipped to Auschwitz	3
many people are unable to make ends meet and are having to take debt out at huge levels of interest.	you have to draw lines	3
If we want to live in a Liberal society that is also tolerant, we must have a set of principles that we all digest and understand, that ground and explain, and justify why we behave as we do	not from the direction Professor Levitas’s coming from	3
This is a very interesting point.	the problem with freedom is it’s become a cuckoo value	3
If somebody’s not willing to reward you by borrowing your savings, there’s no point doing the saving.	the point about a welfare state is it was set up as a safety net, during a time of near full employment	3
if one says that poverty is the cause then someone like RL is dooming these people to live in serial disadvantage and pass it down to their children. Which is what RL's side of the argument has done over several decades	people would require the social context in which work happens	3
It’s been done to them, not done by them	They go up, they go down	3
In terms of moral responsibility then it, is pretty much anything allowed to them because it was a struggle of liberation	it speaks well for the case that is being brought at the moment	3
much debt is incredibly valuable.	we are living in a country with a minimum wage	3
I'm not saying that	I want Barclays to be less able – I think they should be smaller, I want to break it up, I want to break up the investment banking from retail banking; very, very specific.	3
if we’re in a Liberal society, as opposed to a Republican society, we might care about the principal of neutrality;	I think there is a cultural problem within that, but I don’t think that offsets completely the positive attributes of an investment bank.	3
They have absolutely very little choice except to take the terms that are being offered to them	that’s sometimes related not being in work,	3
moral justice lies xxx when we look back at our imperial past	People are no more stupid now than they were 150 years ago	3
In the old days of early capitalism, bankers were famously prudent people	we cannot take away the fact that these were people who were simply fighting to reclaim their lost lands	3
We’re offering things on a rewards based process, which is if the local government succeeds in achieving its results then it gets more money. If it doesn’t, it won’t.	the conditions under which people live aren’t conducive to moral flourishing, and therefore what you want to do is challenge those conditions, change them	3
Owen hasn't answered Anne's question	xxx is how JB regards it	3
it wasn't	bankruptcy is xxx	3
Think about Bill Gates and all the wonderful things that his money is doing.	it is inevitable that the essential immorality of business will infect the way individuals behave who work for it	3
that is a worthwhile ambition	Esther is being selective about her context	3
It’s a bit like saying wearing a jumper is moral	in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	3
What is going on here is xxx	I’m sure they went down the pub afterwards and slapped each other on the back and said you’re a great member of the banker’s club	3
people are naturally creative and industrious, and want to work	the main conversation is, “How do we do compliant adverts?”	3
xxx is the sort of conditionality; or sort of duties RS would expect people on benefit to undertake, in return for that support	decided that this had taught an important lesson that the only way in which the British presence in Africa could be sustained was brutality	3
the trouble with both Kantian and utilitarian morality is it only happens sometimes, we need to get back to the classics.	it depends on the environment	3
that has become incredibly dangerous and insupportable	a carrot and a stick approach to welfare state won't actually solve them	3
The basis of Capitalism is actually that it requires belief and trust and credit.	whether you call them problem, or troubled, the question still remains.	3
many people are unable to make ends meet and are having to take debt out at huge levels of interest.	we don’t allow them to say things which are misleading	3
It's not a question of the British thing	I don’t have problems with hedge funds making a lot of money, the partnership model; if they go bust, they go bust.	3
CF is interested in the demoralising impact of welfarism 	There is lots of research been done to how cultures are being changed; it’s very difficult, but one things is very clear: if there is something rotten at the top, there is no hope for reform at the bottom	3
that is a rather a gloomy view of faith	Anne's completely misunderstood the point of housing benefit	3
JL's industry wants to comply with the regulations that others have determined. Not just in the UK, but in the whole of the EU	No parent in the family is in work	3
it takes a very simple view	CF went to a lot of conferences, with a lot of policy people, who said, “We are living in a new era, the knowledge economy. We don’t have to produce anything anymore. Guess what? I mean, we can...”	3
they are vulnerable	bankruptcy used to be shameful	3
it’s a way of transforming the moral issue from a lack of jobs, a lack of a provision, to an internal failure to do that	Then that leads to poverty, and not to mention family breakdown.	3
that majority doesn't include CL	Ruth would do xxx about it	3
The poor don’t lack that any more than the rich.	A good chunk of the world did notice the boom times that developed countries had.	3
this is quite a tricky discussion	Claire has no answer to Neil's complaint that our market in housing has seriously distorted the housing benefit	3
who are major benefactors	that hints to the kind of schism around citizenship that we have here in the United Kingdom	3
we’re here to discuss the morality	credit advertising is highly regulated	3
If you look at these things, as anyone in work would look at, if you can’t afford to have children the State should not step in and say “Unconditionally, we will support you if you make the decision to have children you can’t afford”	that's not a specific example	3
in terms of the case of these individuals they have a perfect right to pursue the claim that they are making and it is reasonable for the British state, even though today's politicians weren't implicated in this, for the British state to be answerable of the actions of the British state in the past, in this specific case	the history of the financial services industry does not demonstrate that this is an industry with a deep commitment to exploiting those weaknesses	3
If the market doesn’t, for whatever reason it’s because of the failure of Capitalism	There’s a risk that they can be brought up into wonderful families and turn into monsters.	3
It seems to be a mixture of arrogance and absurdity	JB didn’t refer to utopia	3
one of the jobs that the welfare system is quite reputably there to do, is to try and encourage the best of people, and to encourage the best that they can do	we spend about £20 billion as a nation on housing benefit	3
Merthyr Tydfil, in Wales has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country	That was the way our system was supposed to work as well	3
Generally investment banking reflects business and commerce as a whole.	they will only do it if they are regulated	3
the reality is that in the last ten or twenty years there’s been a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, and from the young to the old, and that what Neil's really trying to do is to justify that by blaming the poor for their position	this whole neutrality position is a bit- just a way of getting out of the question.	3
there are two other brackets that I would bring within the troubled family scenario	Romin is overstating Romin's case, and at the same time treating young people as though they won’t cope with living in a garret, bit of poverty but I’ll get by	3
we’ve got a set of good practice parents, good practice child rearing,	that takes ES xxx	3
They’re far more likely as a result to be unemployed in later life	there’s no chance	3
If you take the classic Louise Casey situation: a mother, serially deprived, not been parented herself, can’t look after her child, the child is truanting, the child’s getting into crime, the mother has mental health problems, the mother is abused, non-domination has nothing do with it	there were atrocities on both sides, including in this big group of people that Esther has just referred to	3
you are on the side of the nationalist movements which replaced the British Empire	there’s certainly an argument to look at re-introducing a contributory principle back in to welfare. Something like the French system where if you lose your job you get 70% of your previous wage for a limited period	3
it can if they can get it to the people who need it	JB didn't say that	3
We’re offering things on a rewards based process, which is if the local government succeeds in achieving its results then it gets more money. If it doesn’t, it won’t.	we’re talking here about families with children	3
this is not purely an economic issue	there are many poor people who are not problematic at all.	3
That's not what Esther stated	it was a struggle of liberation	3
that’s actually coming down as a cohort effect anyway	this has somehow changed it to focusing on the individual behaviour	3
The government comes and bails me out	the way in which our politicians defer to it and so forth, that’s the nature of the problem, it’s not the problem of business per se.	3
they are right about that	all debt is not immoral.	3
they can’t get full time work	there are not very specific perpetrators	3
they want voters	The pragmatic justification is that they - if they are to take their case against anybody, we, this state, the British state now, is the closest they can get to it.	3
MT overestimates that	It was a state mechanism to compensate for that, that we have this	3
Ruth has an objection to an intervention on the basis of people being poor, as opposed to an intervention on the basis of children genuinely being at risk of neglect or harm	there’s parents with mental health problems who have lost their ability to care for their children	3
there’s nothing necessarily positive about saving	They're negligent	3
they are seeking civilian reparation	what we need much more is a sense of reciprocity that it’s not just that my interest happens to coincide with yours.	3
that might be breakdown of family, and instability, a welfare system that doesn’t promote work, an education system that doesn’t give you a chance to get a job, debt, alcohol and drugs…	If the market doesn’t, for whatever reason it’s because of the failure of Capitalism	3
Claire's no evidence for Claire's assertions	one that ought to, at least to some extent, be resurrected	3
the colonial context is absent	xxx is how we deal with the fact that so many people now do seem to assume that they can have something for nothing	3
the dismantling of those social norms, and those laws, have made us vulnerable	Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	3
the problem is they are often in low paid work	savers need saving because xxx	3
they have lost their ability to do that	JL's industry wants to comply with the regulations that others have determined. Not just in the UK, but in the whole of the EU	3
people are naturally creative and industrious, and want to work	That surely is the challenge	3
the reason Dante confined them to the lowest circle of hell is because they made a big profit at the expense of very poor people, which was widely regarded as shameful	we’ve done a lot to improve work incentives financially	3
That worries CL very much	If we don’t give more benefits, more welfare, we’re going to end up with homeless young people everywhere, destitution and so on	3
We are here on Mandela's birthday and his leadership in relation to South Africa was one in which he sought to explore these issues, reconcile them, bring them to account, to apologise, to effect reparation where necessary, to acknowledge the crime	They’re both trouble to those within their family, particularly their children, and their and those around them	3
We kidded ourselves during the last decade that we’d solved the problem of unemployment,	that is a good case and something AM does take very seriously	3
xxx is how we encourage the young	People move, in a life course, move in and out of work	3
that’s a hard concept to get hold of in a very individualised society	we have a huge problem with unemployment	3
what we need much more is a sense of reciprocity that it’s not just that my interest happens to coincide with yours.	it’s pushed out all other values	3
there are high levels of concern over their ability to care for their children	that’s a little odd	3
everyone who puts money into a bank, or a building society, is putting it there so that the bank can lend it on	only since the welfare state has there been permanent unemployment	3
the problem is that welfarism has gone far beyond a safety net, or anything compassionate	They are left absolutely high and dry,	3
moral justice lies xxx when we look back at our imperial past	there’s nothing necessarily positive about saving	3
NL thinks xxx	that would not be the British Government's view	3
there’s a risk.	there is very great danger here of stirring up resentment towards people who need welfare to keep house and home together	3
what we have is an artificial suppression of the price of money	xxx is how we deal with the fact that so many people now do seem to assume that they can have something for nothing	3
if Melanie's referring to the problem of absent fathers as a source of poverty and deprivation amongst these troubled families, which are really troubling families. If she's talking about that, then of course there’s issues around the justice of a man’s behavior towards a woman which can raise issues of domination	that’s fair enough	3
the debate about whether the State stepping in telling people to have children or not, is not the debate tonight	I would give, as one example of an organisation that’s changed, the BBC actually, which now tends to be pretty truthful even if only because it wasn’t in the past.	3
NL thinks / does not think we have got a lot to apologize for	that’s not right	3
some people have an innate desire, so called, to work harder than others	Melanie's talking about the de-incentivisation of marriage, on the basis that we can’t possibly talk about marriage as opposed to un-marriage	3
Justice would be multi-facetted	There’s no free education	3
Over a million people, young people, without work, it has a scarring impact	there’s no chance	3
And the problem is, as we have things at the moment, with inflation so high and interest rates at rock bottom, savers are seeing their money taken away from them	“Split up, don’t form couples”	3
the figures are a moral issue	I do not believe in free, free, free market Capitalism, as if there’s absolutely no regulation whatsoever.	3
the Armed Forces is one example	we already have legislation that can deal with keeping children safe and ensuring they get to school on time	3
the Christian faith like the Islamic faith has an account of the way these things should be socially organised	That’s the difference	3
there’s always a problem with any moral argument that says there is an innate desire to do things	the problem is that many people, either knowingly or because credit cards were being thrust at them, have taken on debts they can’t possibly hope to pay	3
In the same way that in other countries which run well and efficient welfare states, have very low unemployment – much lower than we do – it would be as low, or lower as it is there	The constant need for government to regulate JL'S industry	3
That would be a baseline, that children are actually safe	that gives it its specific meaning	3
CF is worried about this debate leading to the pathologising of feckless behaviour by individuals, rather than a more balanced discussion.	in the media there is quite a lot of blame	3
What seems therefore ridiculous is that in order to solve the problem of over dependency on the State in certain families. What they do is, is they parachute in as the State, and usurps people’s moral autonomy	individuals are feckless and lazy	3
we’re in a position now where there isn’t enough housing, and where actually some of the parents suggest if you’re agoraphobic you can’t go out to pay rent.	CL's no more sympathetic to economic determinism, or the idea that poverty creates this than anything else.	3
there is no analogy between the way a company would use rewards to push forward good employees and not other employees.	the household has a low income	3
It’s creative	we don’t allow them to say things which are misleading	3
“Provide that for our young people”	it all changed when xxx	3
That is the source of the subsidy in the lending world, in banking	they are effectively trying to hand over to some kind of stable rule and in certain circumstances you have to suppress	3
When KM asked the first witness about, what was she doing – teaching people to live with poverty, she said “No”	he was rather flattering about the virtue of putting off making buying decisions until you can actually afford it, which is a very old-fashioned virtue	3
AB talks about neutrality as a principle	SR is shying away from stigma	3
JB doesn't start from that position	if the integrated investment banks can’t actually manage their activities on a sensible ethical basis	3
a young person decides to take out a mortgage, which is taking out a massive debt, so that they don’t have to be dependent on their parents, or don’t have to be maybe dependent on a council house. It’s a sign of independence.	CF went to a lot of conferences, with a lot of policy people, who said, “We are living in a new era, the knowledge economy. We don’t have to produce anything anymore. Guess what? I mean, we can...”	3
this is quite a tricky discussion	it was in fact typical	3
relative to many other countries surely it's an exemplar of inclusivity	AB talks about neutrality as a principle	3
both sides of the transaction suffer as a result of ignoring moral hazard	MT didn't learn that in school, 40 years ago	3
it can be dangerous, and particularly for the most vulnerable	If I lend you money, I'm taking a risk	3
people can be tempted out of work	The constant need for government to regulate JL'S industry	3
a lot of people are making no provision for their future	it’s about creating conditions for them to make their own decisions	3
It is the illusion that there is a utopia that has led to the idea that you can give people money for not working, and that will cause no perverse results	Enoch Powell acknowledged the maltreatment of the Mau Mau in a stirring speech	3
Enoch Powell acknowledged the maltreatment of the Mau Mau in a stirring speech	it does need reform	3
that does undermine the moral fibre of a country	There is lots of research been done to how cultures are being changed; it’s very difficult, but one things is very clear: if there is something rotten at the top, there is no hope for reform at the bottom	3
there is a minimum for any work, sort of the standards that we would perceive	When you think about it now, CF finds it frustrating when she's trying to talk to people about the real state the economy is in	3
It’s a virtue	The aim of the Government is very clear; looking at family households that are multiply disadvantaged	3
You would think that you were imposing a kind of domination on your neighbors if you were just behaving very badly, and making everybody’s lives a misery around you	not all debt is bad	3
they’re not naturally lazy	I get loans pushed on me all the time	3
If that’s the kind of job system that Neil wants, it seems to be a deeply immoral way of dealing with the quest of work, and how people should look at work	JB's never referred to them being work shy	3
they’re going to try and serve its purposes	it is / is not moral to ask people to work in a job that doesn’t really pay them that much more than being on benefits	3
Helen would like social workers, the State, to teach people to do xxx	if you wanted to pay to work and to create a culture of work, it might be useful to have work in the first place, to have proper jobs at proper wages in the first place	3
it is far better, a better form of intervention, to provide decent jobs and decent wages, affordable housing	There is no universal definition in relation to its application  	3
You talk about greed; people are indeed very angry about large bankers bonuses.	they find it hard to put the two at odds, and to understand that they ought to be leaning towards the common good and not towards personal and individual interest	3
we are getting to the point where debt is simply going out of control	MB's been reading it too	3
Many people would raise their eyebrows at the idea that investment banks are successful in terms of managing risks.	that’s fair enough	3
James and Neil’re not just welfare rangers, though they are welfare rangers	Helen doesn't take the second point	3
that’s sometimes related not being in work,	in this particular case, what are crimes now were very much crimes then	3
we only saw riots last year with young people saying “Why shouldn’t I have this? Why shouldn’t I have that?”	there is something wrong with people saying, “I want to go on holiday and I'm going to take out a loan for it. And I think I can pay that back.”	3
people are incentivised to remain unemployed	it’s almost as though people won’t take account of the fact they’ve got absolutely no money	3
That surely is the challenge	they are right about that	3
there’s a risk.	we should move towards a system which is more based on what you deserve	3
these were not terrorists	RS makes xxx of Mr Cameron’s point that paying young people to move out of their parents’ home doesn’t mean they’re independent, they’re just dependent on other people’s parents	3
young people should go out and get something from the world, contribute something to the world. Instead of saying “Why can’t I get a well paid job? Why can’t I get a house?”	whether you call them problem, or troubled, the question still remains.	3
you are stretching your definition in order to make the British Empire fit into that?	there’s certainly an argument to look at re-introducing a contributory principle back in to welfare. Something like the French system where if you lose your job you get 70% of your previous wage for a limited period	3
It can’t be shamed into good behaviour, or even punished into good behaviour.	poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause.	3
In the same way that in other countries which run well and efficient welfare states, have very low unemployment – much lower than we do – it would be as low, or lower as it is there	it speaks well for the case that is being brought at the moment	3
From the last witness, Alexander Brown, we heard the limits of ultra Libertarianism,	Claire's a campaigner for more housing	3
the idea of ‘the’ problem family is a useful invention that’s been used again and again to police the poor, and to place the blame for social problems on individuals	one thing KM may not be aware of is just how much benefits have been cut already by inflation	3
one of the things that RS picked up when he was listening in the green room was about this idea of this demoralisation	They do bear responsibility.	3
that’s a little odd	it is / is not moral to ask people to work in a job that doesn’t really pay them that much more than being on benefits	3
Alexander shouldn't assume that poverty drives everything	yes you can have a different structure for the industry, but you end up back with investment banks.	3
they need help getting back on track	they’ve over broadened their remit over recent years	3
there is both a pragmatic and a historic justification	if you get it slightly wrong you cause yourself a major problem, and you have the Office of Fair Trading on your back straight away, as is happening now with some leaders	3
we’ve done a lot to improve work incentives financially	this figure of 120,000 which has already been floated several times in this discussion, is entirely spurious	3
they have nowhere to go	welfarism has become an all consuming be all and end all for a significant minority of society	3
they’ve never had it	This idea that you know, if your mother didn’t love you or you had a terrible background – sometimes the children, the daughters of those families become the most wonderful, careful mothers precisely as a reaction.	3
it was an unjust war that was being levelled against the Africans	the whole of their future is not being blighted, even though it might have been a horrible experience	3
There are many families, and Louise Casey has this in mind, where for a variety of reasons a lone mother – and it’s usually a lone mother – cannot look after her children properly, doesn’t know how to very often	we are quite hung up about this	3
in itself there is / is not a danger there	Investment banks are characterised by a culture which is just pure exultant, rampant individualism.	3
that's the great difference between the Empire and Nazism	we are just providing the work that people want to do	3
The aim of the Government is very clear; looking at family households that are multiply disadvantaged	the economy is in such a terrible state that in order to expand the economy, and get us out of this crisis, we have to encourage people to borrow.	3
They get nothing out of it	there is an internal failure in some cases	3
they should really be angry with their government for not addressing the underlying social policy issues	people are still going to investment banks with ethical problems.	3
It's a specific case	Ruth quarrelled with the statistics	3
we cannot take away the fact that these were people who were simply fighting to reclaim their lost lands	Christian does not realize that it isn’t necessarily coming from a poor background that determines what happens in the future. Or in fact a wonderful loving family, you can end up as some dissipated wreck, alcoholic millionaire kid	3
these programs from other countries, they work	if you follow this guide then everything will be alright in the world	3
colonialism is xxx	this actually has a fine tradition elsewhere	3
we could move some of that money around so it’s less for not working and more for going into work, and supporting those people who are trying hard on low wages, and who we want to see succeed	JL doesn’t buy that at all	3
that in my view damns people	Sometimes people just want to have more children, even if they can’t afford them	3
it wasn't	JL's industry should simply be ethical	3
Ethics relies upon, in some sense, hierarchy; some hierarchical authority, and in some sense a social purpose. But actually, neither of those things exist in investment banks	politicians are not taking a moral stance over welfare reform	3
people should not have to pay their debts	The poor don’t lack that any more than the rich.	3
you’re leaving out a good chunk of the world which is still sitting there in poverty and didn’t really notice the boom times that some of us had in the developed countries	that’s begging a lot of questions	3
I get loans pushed on me all the time	it’s requirement	3
that’s the distinction	There is a problem with judging the past by our values	3
debt that actually goes to something that’s productive, and actually helps, is to be encouraged. 	it is imbued with geography, history and culture	3
In one of the US states that went the furthest in this in diverting people from being on welfare, they managed at one point to reduce the number of people on benefits by 90%	That's racially offensive	3
The State can provide information, guidance, and assistance on a voluntary basis.	you put a pound in	3
that help should be very carefully calibrated, to restore the capacity for independence and personal responsibility	MT would adopt a more kind of quasi Marxist position	3
Esther was also giving wider views around the importance of this case	It is not a family where children are on the threshold of being taken away	3
Many people would raise their eyebrows at the idea that investment banks are successful in terms of managing risks.	It can be a way of demonstrating independence	3
there is a deep moral instinct which says that the whole business of lending and borrowing is a highly moral area, or, if you like, a dangerous moral area	the banks are so terrified that if they crystallise the debts their balance sheets will be insupportable.	3
it takes a very simple view	the young guy’d lost his job at Tesco	3
it was in fact typical	they’re not able to impose the right sort of levels	3
we could move some of that money around so it’s less for not working and more for going into work, and supporting those people who are trying hard on low wages, and who we want to see succeed	We can’t start dividing the population between the deserving and the undeserving	3
I might not take back from the National Health Service or from the welfare state, the things that I put in, the money that I put in through my tax	that’s a hard concept to get hold of in a very individualised society	3
you have just demonised an entire group of people.	people who grow up in very difficult families don’t run a risk of being difficult themselves	3
theres' nothing wrong with doing the British thing, owning up and paying up	A kind of parental determinism emerges that’s overly fatalistic as well	3
the growth of what Claire calls ‘welfarism’ is to do with, firstly the disappearance of so many skilled middle income jobs; and secondly due to the failure to build social housing	we would say freedom fighters	3
It can be a way of demonstrating independence	bankruptcy is xxx	3
we’ve partly privatised morality	that’s not their fault	3
the extent to which an African American is prepared to stand by the flag is far in advance than any black British individual	there’s parents with mental health problems who have lost their ability to care for their children	3
They're average people on the whole	the Armed Forces is one example	3
that’s a hard concept to get hold of in a very individualised society	we’re not going to get rid of the welfare state	3
this is quite a tricky discussion	things start going wrong when you depress the price of money	3
investment banks that have highly public ethical problems don’t lose their clients.	Ruth has an objection to an intervention on the basis of people being poor, as opposed to an intervention on the basis of children genuinely being at risk of neglect or harm	3
Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	If the market doesn’t, for whatever reason never mind who’s fault it is, then the next thing that the government should do, is to provide jobs for these people to do	3
otherwise I don’t receive self-respect	they are unethical rather than despite it	3
that it is a problem	That is the source of the subsidy in the lending world, in banking	3
If the market doesn’t, for whatever reason it’s because of the failure of Capitalism	if you have become unemployed and you’ve paid in in the past, you’ll get a more generous rate of benefits than people who haven’t paid in	3
Ethics relies upon, in some sense, hierarchy; some hierarchical authority, and in some sense a social purpose. But actually, neither of those things exist in investment banks	People find it very difficult in a very strongly individualistic culture to understand what’s being meant by the phrase the common good	3
MB's been reviewing it.	they should just get on the bus to Cardiff	3
It’s been created by a sense of impunity, of invulnerability	sometimes taking out credit can also help you not be dependent.	3
my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	There is an advantage to oaths that we should realise, that we should recognise	3
we’re not so much aware that trust is lacking	that’s not their fault	3
household debt is about £55,000	there is a problem	3
There’s all sorts of things to be said for Capitalism, but Capitalism is also a dangerous thing	a lot of listeners will be thinking, “What is the point of being prudent? There’s no reward for it whatsoever.”	3
That’s the definition that the Government is using	the situation in Kenya was a bloody dirty war	3
This is a very interesting point.	We had a boom that was fuelled by government spending and by debt, too much of which did not go to productive uses	3
this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	who are major benefactors	3
we lack any sense of the common good	Their monthly incomes vary enormously	3
I'm not saying that	we haven’t actually done as much as we could have done	3
in contrast to, say, America, you don't have a kind of polarisation between black and white here in the way that you do there.	there is not a danger that we’ll actually make things worse	3
the growth of what Claire calls ‘welfarism’ is to do with, firstly the disappearance of so many skilled middle income jobs; and secondly due to the failure to build social housing	we actually encourage people to become dependent on the state	3
One assumes they’re not very tasteful.  	MT has got to look at the underlying economic incentives	3
it is not	it’s not neutrality at all	3
youth unemployment is a blight on our nation	The problem is that so much debt has been acquired that has gone towards non-productive usage	3
incentives and compulsions are irrelevant.	the benefit system is precisely one of those systems that encourages immoral behaviour	3
Helen would take, and Family Action, a much broader view about who troubled families actually are	The are other instances that bring up questions about imperial rule	3
people would require the social context in which work happens	They manage risk	3
someone will always find a way around a rule.	we are just providing the work that people want to do	3
That's a caricature	that’s sometimes related not being in work,	3
CL's no more sympathetic to economic determinism, or the idea that poverty creates this than anything else.	that’s the decider	3
MP wouldn't go as far as Lawrence James went	she represents justice and the common good	3
KM didn’t ask JB that	it wasn't	3
there is nothing wrong with what she’s doing	they’ll show you how to do it	3
there’s a risk.	there are families that are so troubled that family intervention programmes are appropriate.	3
when news first came of the horrific massacre of Mau Mau prisoners in Kenya. Wide swathes of British public opinion and the media and the Prime Minister and most of the Cabinet were horrified and disgusted then, not now, then	People have survived that for centuries	3
that’s coming down as a cohort effect	this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	3
It creates a dependency on work	The people who lose money are the taxpayers	3
JL's industry should simply be ethical	We are here on Mandela's birthday and his leadership in relation to South Africa was one in which he sought to explore these issues, reconcile them, bring them to account, to apologise, to effect reparation where necessary, to acknowledge the crime	3
they’ll show you how to do it	It used to be, when SR was younger, when his parents and grandparents were around, that saving was the moral thing to do	3
for the State to start telling people whether or not they should have children, however tempting it might be in any individual case, is a very, very dangerous slippery slope	the system seems to be very, very heavily weighted against them.	3
it can be dangerous, and particularly for the most vulnerable	Britain is actually very unusual compared to other countries	3
it’s going back to the politics of the poor house	it doesn't really answer why there was such outrage about it	3
that position was non-judgmentalism	that’s a big moral problem	3
what JL's doing is providing small loans, for short periods of time, to help them smooth out their family income	these companies, in their marketing departments, sit down and say to themselves, “When we’re advertising our products, we should make sure that consumers really, really, really understand what they’re getting in for”?  / they sit down and think, “How can we get customers to buy our products, by putting in the shop window the most generous possible figures in the hope that they won’t understand that that’s just an offer to lure them in”?	3
they’ll show you how to do it	in itself there is / is not a danger there	3
Not to be in a funk when you are reading intelligence reports which suggest your Empire is under sustained assault	everything can just carry on	3
this is the moral maze	the Government is / is not right in its definition of the problem	3
MP has some savings, and MP has some borrowings as well .	I think you exaggerate	3
that is a rather a gloomy view of faith	there are not very specific perpetrators	3
you could say that at the moment one of the problems is that there’s not enough credit being released creatively	investment banks that have highly public ethical problems don’t lose their clients.	3
it’s going back to the politics of the poor house	It’s not overwhelming	3
xxx is the template the Government is seeking to replicate	Esther would not be also happy for them to face trial for atrocities committed against white settlers and British service personnel at the time	3
they really reduce unemployment	Lawrence James wants to muddy the waters	3
we have a huge problem with unemployment.	these were not terrorists	3
they should do xxx in order to look after their children	that’s sometimes related not being in work	3
I get loans pushed on me all the time	we had money lenders from one religious persuasion unable to lend to their own persuasion, but happily would lend to those of another religious persuasion	3
JB likens it to a mouse trap which has a rather stale piece of cheese in it	one generation’s fortunes are rather dependant on how the generation before them treated them	3
families have low income	In a sense he’s very similar to the abolition of the Board and Lodgings Allowance that Margaret Thatcher brought in at the end of the ‘80s, which obviously saw a huge spike in rough sleeping	3
If you look at the wider measure of all the people on benefits: the people on incapacity benefit, the people on income support as well. Actually, even all the way through the years of the debt fuelled boom we had about 5 million people effectively workless	in the developed world that wasn’t making enough money	3
both money and debt are essentially morally neutral	it is because they’re disruptive / because they’re disadvantaged	3
it seems to me that’s it’s almost as if you had a water utility, a hybrid company of a water utility, and a casino and then when the casino goes bust they say “Well I’m terribly sorry, we’re a water utility really, so we can’t go bust.”	Claire's argued that we should build over green belt	3
people who don’t work, who are unemployed, are depressed.	this means nothing	3
this is quite a tricky discussion	It’s only since the state intervened that people have been uninterested in which bank they put their money in	3
there’s nothing necessarily positive about saving	Ruth would do xxx about it	3
there’s certainly a point that welfare spending in this country is too high	they cannot cope with the consequences of this progressive and incremental social family breakdown. 	3
poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause.	Ruth quarrelled with the statistics	3
it’s been pointed out that borrowing money can have disadvantages, as well as advantages	In the marketing department	3
we cannot take away the fact that these were people who were simply fighting to reclaim their lost lands	Christian's being deterministic	3
Claire has an answer to Neil's complaint that the market in housing has seriously distorted the housing benefit	There are two different views about State intervention.	3
that is not so morally wrong	there is no statute of limitations	3
They do	there is a problem	3
the way people respond, people’s agency, is inevitably in the context of the lives in which they live	entrepreneurs could get the credit	3
xxx is the nature of the conversation in the marketing departments	they are right about that	3
if one says that poverty is the cause then someone like RL is dooming these people to live in serial disadvantage and pass it down to their children. Which is what RL's side of the argument has done over several decades	xxx is the template the Government is seeking to replicate	3
it should be about a bit of both	it’s because of government interference	3
We're looking at this case in a multiple ways	Owen wants to take housing benefit down	3
The incidents of real ethical abuses, let alone criminal abuses, in investment banking is actually very small.	you don’t just start having children, without your other circumstances being taken into account	3
if Melanie's referring to the problem of absent fathers as a source of poverty and deprivation amongst these troubled families, which are really troubling families. If she's talking about that, then of course there’s issues around the justice of a man’s behavior towards a woman which can raise issues of domination	the system, if it has an impact, has an impact	3
This is often a working benefit	In some ways you need that discipline, to be a saver, to think, “I won’t get into debt”	3
this emphasis on the individual moral shortcomings of parents is overly simplistic and doesn’t help	people do take those jobs	3
The Armed Forces is a very good example	that is a moral position to take	3
they don't have a sense of entitlement from the state rather than a sense of self-reliance	you have just demonised an entire group of people.	3
the reason banks take excessive risk is that they don’t pay the price for that risk-taking, because of the government guarantee	The number of people that fall in the category that the 120,000 comes from, has been falling since 2004	3
it's not only the right to a job that RS'd accept	if a child’s brought up into a poor family that that’s going to make their life worse?	3
Clifford was more sympathetic to James	you’d not use that argument to explain the reason, for example, why we have an increase in obesity, and claim that the supermarkets are exploiting people’s desire for food	3
Michael Portillo should lend Michael Buerk a fiver	a punitive welfare state, a welfare state which attempts to socially engineer, attempts to prod and poke people ‘carrot and stick’ into work, is not sufficient to break this apparent perceived cycle	3
That's what drove it	that is really quite  in al this	3
the British state knew what they were doing 	James made this very clear – James wasn’t blaming individuals	3
If that’s the kind of job system that Neil wants, it seems to be a deeply immoral way of dealing with the quest of work, and how people should look at work	People are no more stupid now than they were 150 years ago	3
many of the families they have to teach them how to have fun, and enjoy their children	Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	3
there's nothing wrong with this	abolishing housing benefit for under 25s will lead to homelessness, hidden homelessness, sofa surfing, staying with the wrong people	3
if you look at the figures, fatherlessness, family breakdown, is disproportionately represented in all these social problems. 	quite broadly in society, some of the problems we have is that behaviours which are self-destructive, and also anti-social, are not stigmatised	3
they are vulnerable	One is a kind of rule-based morality, which says, “We will impose standards on people, because that’s how they get better.”	3
they are on the edges or actually committing crime	You have to enforce a culture that makes people think broadly about ethics; that has to come from both outside and inside.	3
if you took something like ‘welfare to work’ set up by a Democrat American president who simply thought that too many people in the underclass were getting trapped in a dependency that wasn’t good for them, wasn’t good for their children, he was also being too punitive	we should be very circumspect in the way we intervene in families,	3
corporations have no souls to damn and no bodies to kick.	not all debt is bad	3
this activity is not taking advantage of people in a moment of great weakness	these companies, in their marketing departments, sit down and say to themselves, “When we’re advertising our products, we should make sure that consumers really, really, really understand what they’re getting in for”?  / they sit down and think, “How can we get customers to buy our products, by putting in the shop window the most generous possible figures in the hope that they won’t understand that that’s just an offer to lure them in”?	3
the problem we always have with debt, which SR would use rather than credit, is that ultimately there is interest.	It is the case that some of the greatest examples of social progress over the years have come from well-off rich people, banks and so on, investing productively	3
the problem of social justice is these 120,000 families	the debate about whether the State stepping in telling people to have children or not, is not the debate tonight	3
this argument as benefits somehow taking people out of jobs, or disincentivising people simply doesn’t work	The real question is to ask “What is the best welfare state we can make, in the real world?”	3
if you get into debt, and you can never get out of it, that’s slavery	black people can't be racist in the United Kingdom context	3
they were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of young people, desperate for work	It’s a social issue, not a moral issue.	3
It’s actually rather immoral to come up with this kind of structurally derived argument that says, “Your job is really – or our job, collectively – is just to say to people ‘we will not put up with these situations and encourage political action’”.	we have to starve people	3
they’re not naturally lazy	In the old days of early capitalism, bankers were famously prudent people	3
there should be a window of apology and getting back to common sense.	JA wants a moment that would produce more inclusivity	3
Kenya was a brutal war,	a country can even say, “We’re going to go bankrupt. It’s humiliating. We’ll do it. We’ll start again. We’ll grow	3
What is going on here is xxx	there’s parents with mental health problems who have lost their ability to care for their children	3
evidence shows that those who are in poverty are more likely to be facing all of these other forms of disadvantage	Claire has no answer to Neil's complaint that our market in housing has seriously distorted the housing benefit	3
you can help them get back on their feet and able to parent their children effectively	JL's industry should not need to be wrapped up in red tape	3
we’re rather over inclined - and this is also a moral issue – to focus on the anti social behaviour of the poor, rather than the antisocial behaviour of the rich: the money laundering, the rate fixing, the tax evasion	If you’re going to work very hard for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and you’re going to make only £1 more than you would have made on benefits the urge to get a job is not as strong as it would be if you’d otherwise be penniless	3
it seems to be odd that JW talks about culture so much, and doesn’t refer to the cultural norms that are created by the dominance of those models	there is no statute of limitations	3
It was a ghastly aberration	they make more money out of it	3
that’s the decider	We reckon something like 100 billion pounds has been transferred from savers to borrowers.	3
you can be in a situation where you say, “We will let you write off your debts, without incurring moral hazard.”	I’m sure they went down the pub afterwards and slapped each other on the back and said you’re a great member of the banker’s club	3
society benefits/ society suffers	it’s about creating conditions for them to make their own decisions	3
in order to finance the trade and the extraction of resource in African countries, infrastructure was built and there was a degree of benevolence	there’s some very virtuous people who work in the City of London and do extraordinarily good things with their money.	3
black people can't be racist in the United Kingdom context	he didn't half did	3
we are getting to the point where debt is simply going out of control	the initiative is ‘troubled families’, not ‘troublesome families’.	3
we’re not so much aware that trust is lacking	one of the problems we’re facing now is the fact that organisations, and indeed people who require debt, that what we’re doing is rolling everything over	3
the fundamentals of the economy aren’t generating what you want	my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	3
Investment banks have to become environments where the risk, all the risk, falls on the people within the institutions.	That means not simply looking at the individual, but to change the conditions and provide those sorts of conditions.	3
Acknowledgment, in a Christian sense	if we’re going to discuss morality, we have to discuss the immorality of political leaders.	3
the welfare state should be about what people need/what they deserve	the first witness made some very interesting points	3
If one lot of people is going to give another lot of people money, that second lot of people should be willing to work, and should work.	we do have a moral duty to intervene quite robustly in that situation	3
they cannot cope with the consequences of this progressive and incremental social family breakdown. 	the present government of Britain should be held responsible for responsibility for the these atrocities of its predecessor administration many decades ago	3
I think it’s not going to help change the culture	If you’re staying on your mates coach and all the rest of it, and you get a job, you want to prove that you’re going to not just kind of go “Oh well, it’s not that much money.” You’ll use it, that’s what you want.	3
I think in order to change investment banks you have to actually focus on not just specific rules, which in the introduction was described as ‘box ticking’,	they make more money out of it	3
Ruth would do xxx about it	some of the world is suffering from the impact of development on climate change, for example.	3
that argument is even stronger if the people you’re relying on are not your friends and family, but other people you don’t even know	it’s these broader circumstances that we really need to get to the nub of	3
the problem we always have with debt, which SR would use rather than credit, is that ultimately there is interest.	Ruth quarrelled with the statistics	3
Housing benefit has not a debilitating ?effect	it is simply the case that buying a cup of coffee is something which is substantially less demanding than working up a long-term interest rate	3
some people are not working because they can make a penny more from giving up their job and living at home	you can be convicted of being racially offensive without being a racist	3
it can if they can get it to the people who need it	You are just scapegoating an entire bunch of people, the vast majority of whom one has no reason to believe do anything other than behave with honesty and integrity.	3
it builds your character	they are due reparation	3
they cannot cope with the consequences of this progressive and incremental social family breakdown. 	we should be very circumspect in the way we intervene in families,	3
it’s to do with credit liberalisation in the United States.	A lot of savers have spent much of their life putting money by, in the hope that they can provide for themselves in their old age.	3
what we have is an artificial suppression of the price of money	that would be the view of the claimants and their representatives. And also the current government of Kenya.	3
if the integrated investment banks can’t actually manage their activities on a sensible ethical basis	in order to finance the trade and the extraction of resource in African countries, infrastructure was built and there was a degree of benevolence	3
we already have legislation that can deal with keeping children safe and ensuring they get to school on time	there’s been a transfer	3
and it’s fundamentally immoral	who are major benefactors	3
It’s not overwhelming	the government guarantees your welfare in old age	3
Ruth doesn't like the definition of troubled families, or anything much about all of this	it's not racism	3
MB's been reading it too	the history of America shows that.	3
That is not the world we live in	I think it’s not going to help change the culture	3
it's a symbolic case, to open a wider door	it would not be in the interest of banks to lend money to people who can’t afford to repay it. Unless the banks knew that someone else was going to meet their problem	3
You didn’t want to be a burden on the state	this is not just saying “Social services should do it”	3
within that bracket Helen would certainly put families who are living with very high levels of aggression and violence, who are terrorising communities	Some of the people who are doing these wonderful things, and show that they value things in life well beyond money, are also somehow running these really crooked organisation	3
and therefore the only way forward was for Britain to withdraw	these are banking reforms, they’re not moral	3
it's a situation where, six years before the start of the Kenya emergency, the British Army in India is being hammered by the nationalists and the Muslims	I think the way we run the economy is responsible for a decline in our morality	3
these were not terrorists	what she was really talking about is forcing people to adapt to their conditions of poverty, rather than challenging those conditions or creating conditions where moral behaviour could better flourish.	3
that would be a good way of incentivising work	It’s a social issue, not a moral issue.	3
that’s a hard concept to get hold of in a very individualised society	this is quite a tricky discussion	3
troubled families / troublesome families is / is not the crux of it	there’s two ways we can look at this	3
Helen and Claire should be clear that Helen and Claire’re talking about 120,000 families	You have to enforce a culture that makes people think broadly about ethics; that has to come from both outside and inside.	3
angels are very difficult to select, but it has to start at the top	it is not	3
We’re pretending the problem isn’t there	it is a good point Clifford makes	3
it takes a very simple view	we’ve got a set of good practice parents, good practice child rearing,	3
let’s not just call them ‘scroungers’	If one lot of people is going to give another lot of people money, that second lot of people should be willing to work, and should work.	3
there’s a demand of equal concern that the State has for everyone, such that if these interventions are not working for the most needy cases	there’s certain people you just say, “You shouldn’t have children, you’re not fit to have children”	3
the factors will lead to this	there are about six times more savers than borrowers	3
Ruth would do xxx about it	They’re completely negligent in this area	3
it is the knock down argument	moral justice lies xxx when we look back at our imperial past	3
nearly two million people t working tax credit, which means that they are in jobs which are so badly paid that they can’t survive, that they require benefits	we had money lenders from one religious persuasion unable to lend to their own persuasion, but happily would lend to those of another religious persuasion	3
If you're talking about internationally, then racism is not just a dictionary definition	That is interesting	3
You’re kidding CF	what we need to look at is we need to look at other ways of incentivising; making work pay. Looking at the barriers that exist for young people to get into work	3
if you wanted to pay to work and to create a culture of work, it might be useful to have work in the first place, to have proper jobs at proper wages in the first place	There is no problem  here.	3
housing benefit, particularly when paid out very young to so many young people, has a debilitating-	If somebody’s not willing to reward you by borrowing your savings, there’s no point doing the saving.	3
Cameron’s concerns resonate with perhaps the majority	they shouldn't resort to petty crime, rather than take benefits	3
they want voters	This is often a working benefit	3
the reason why we should care about the poor, is because the poor are really the victims of this	these are largely poor areas	3
we cannot for legal reasons go into sort of identifying individuals	The poor don’t lack that any more than the rich.	3
There is no simple way out of these kinds of dilemmas	there’s a huge amount of evidence, research, academic anecdotal that says certain factors make it much more likely that you will not exit poverty, or you won’t prevent poverty. Poverty being more than income, by the way	3
it is reasonable to argue that given what they went through, as the closest they can get to the people who perpetrated this is the British state, indeed the state benefitted from colonialism in a variety of ways, it's reasonable that they should seek recompense from the British state	Evidence shows that lack of marriage leads to poverty	3
if you took something like ‘welfare to work’ set up by a Democrat American president who simply thought that too many people in the underclass were getting trapped in a dependency that wasn’t good for them, wasn’t good for their children, he was also being too punitive	the way in which our politicians defer to it and so forth, that’s the nature of the problem, it’s not the problem of business per se.	3
that takes ES xxx	the wider context is the colonial dispossession	3
Generally investment banking reflects business and commerce as a whole.	You are just scapegoating an entire bunch of people, the vast majority of whom one has no reason to believe do anything other than behave with honesty and integrity.	3
They are left absolutely high and dry,	They do bear responsibility.	3
you are stretching your definition in order to make the British Empire fit into that?	I certainly get indirect effects; indirect goods.	3
that undermines the whole argument that you make about incentives	I think the interesting thing is that banks do have codes of ethics, but to the extent they have them they are incredibly disappointing, if not total crap.	3
it’s quite striking that all three witnesses, coming from very different positions, put their finger on that	lending money at interest isn't shameful	3
I think the problem is much more complicated than that	If you're talking about internationally, then racism is not just a dictionary definition	3
the context for the atrocities having been carried out by agents of the British Government at the time, the context was the atrocities being carried out against them by the Mau Mau	what we need is more houses	3
some of the world is suffering from the impact of development on climate change, for example.	it has to be understood amongst a basket of values including things like fairness	3
They don’t want to stop it	It doesn’t expect that if you have a false set of structures, or a false set of purposes, that everything will be fine if you just have very good individuals	3
it can if they can get it to the people who need it	I think the interesting thing is that banks do have codes of ethics, but to the extent they have them they are incredibly disappointing, if not total crap.	3
there are lots of other people who are lenders too	there is a deep moral instinct which says that the whole business of lending and borrowing is a highly moral area, or, if you like, a dangerous moral area	3
a lot of listeners will be thinking, “What is the point of being prudent? There’s no reward for it whatsoever.”	MT didn't learn that in school, 40 years ago	3
Claire has an answer to Neil's complaint that the market in housing has seriously distorted the housing benefit	MT overestimates that	3
the fundamental message of consumer capitalism is one which says, “Forget deferred gratification. Forget endeavour. Buy it now.”	they need help getting back on track	3
Without these things it doesn’t function.	We’ve had a welfare system now for decades that says, “We will pay you more to be on benefits than to take work.”	3
the present government of Britain should be held responsible for responsibility for the these atrocities of its predecessor administration many decades ago	it’s, as it were, intellectually honest to kind of play out the virtues of saving, as opposed to borrowing, when really, unless the two kind of balance out in an economy, there’s no point saving	3
I welcomed them to the Church actually	the context for the atrocities having been carried out by agents of the British Government at the time, the context was the atrocities being carried out against them by the Mau Mau	3
It can’t be shamed into good behaviour, or even punished into good behaviour.	she represents justice and the common good	3
it’s a good idea, in a free society, to free people if they do get into terrible debt	you can see an observable reality, is that families exist who are trouble	3
that would be the view of the claimants and their representatives. And also the current government of Kenya.	a lot of listeners will be thinking, “What is the point of being prudent? There’s no reward for it whatsoever.”	3
that is a rather a gloomy view of faith	one of the jobs that the welfare system is quite reputably there to do, is to try and encourage the best of people, and to encourage the best that they can do	3
bosses don’t really know what’s going on	The oath taken by the Queen is another very good example.	3
they’ll be the first, often, to admit they need a lot of help.	I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	3
People move, in a life course, move in and out of work	the figures are not a moral issue	3
First witness's not here to demonize debt	one generation’s fortunes are rather dependant on how the generation before them treated them	3
the welfare system is the problem	that gives it its specific meaning	3
JB does not blame the people-	individual faith, whatever it’s kind – religious faith or secular faith – faith is completely contingent on our social circumstances	3
all debt is not immoral.	there’s a danger here that Christian basically cannot see a possibility of breaking this, or people breaking it themselves	3
the issue is one of poverty, and resources.	there are families that are in trouble	3
Those different structures relate to a different sense of what the purpose of money is	that’s what William Beveridge wanted when he was designing the welfare state	3
it’s a way of transforming the moral issue from a lack of jobs, a lack of a provision, to an internal failure to do that	Housing benefit has not a debilitating ?effect	3
it needs thoughtful reform to avoid the tendency that it has to trap people in dependency as a way of life	Then that leads to poverty, and not to mention family breakdown.	3
these aspects have been looked at in huge detail in the last 10 years by government, by consumer groups, by the industry, by academics	that's the great difference between the Empire and Nazism	3
many people are working who get it	William Beveridge thought about having this two-tier system	3
they are effectively trying to hand over to some kind of stable rule and in certain circumstances you have to suppress	she is trying to do something about children- the whole scheme is trying to do that	3
There’s a risk that they can be brought up into wonderful families and turn into monsters.	I think that competence is lacking in the banking industry	3
they’re not just playing with their own money	CF's got no savings	3
JB likens it to a mouse trap which has a rather stale piece of cheese in it	there are many forms of state intervention	3
They can be prejudiced against white people	Some regulation might help	3
it’s to do with credit liberalisation in the United States.	that’s not right	3
there’s a demand of equal concern that the State has for everyone, such that if these interventions are not working for the most needy cases	we are just providing the work that people want to do	3
Liberal societies have often known that the family can be a nexus for forms of unequal opportunity	people should do xxx in a place like Merthyr Tydfil	3
there's nothing wrong with this	it’s an interesting thought experiment to say that the young could survive on their own, because they’ve got the get up and go, and we should let the witnesses at it, is worth considering	3
what AB and AM’re talking about here is non-domination	they’re not going to do it on their own	3
they're in debt	There is a problem with judging the past by our values	3
here you don't have specific perpetrators.	the problem is that the only thing the banks have done is kind of consumer credit	3
this is a moral programme	Generally investment banking reflects business and commerce as a whole.	3
it’s obvious	The poor don’t lack that any more than the rich.	3
JB wants to get rid of the welfare state, the welfare system	The basis of Capitalism is actually that it requires belief and trust and credit.	3
You take someone like Bob Diamond, in other industries he would have been sent off for two years to run branch banking so he knew more about it, before becoming a group Chief Executive.	it is / is not right in its strategy for tackling it	3
It can be a way of demonstrating independence	It’s a social issue, not a moral issue.	3
if one is a Liberal, the principal of neutrality is as good as any other.	it is a good point Clifford makes	3
they do need help	The people who lose money are the taxpayers	3
I would give, as one example of an organisation that’s changed, the BBC actually, which now tends to be pretty truthful even if only because it wasn’t in the past.	It’s only since the state intervened that people have been uninterested in which bank they put their money in	3
When KM asked the first witness about, what was she doing – teaching people to live with poverty, she said “No”	that is the moral way of getting people to pay their rent on time	3
the knowledge is bounded	I’m talking about the essential shell of a company that it is actually essentially amoral. It’s not a person is it, in the sense that you and I are. It doesn’t have a conscience; it can’t be shamed. that morality is bound to affect the way people behave who work for it	3
she is trying to do something about children- the whole scheme is trying to do that	JB's no idea whether it’s innate	3
It is the illusion that there is a utopia that has led to the idea that you can give people money for not working, and that will cause no perverse results	that is a good case and something AM does take very seriously	3
that would be great	One is a kind of rule-based morality, which says, “We will impose standards on people, because that’s how they get better.”	3
There is an advantage to oaths that we should realise, that we should recognise	by hitching society’s wellbeing to free market Capitalism we’ve made a pact with the devil we can’t get out of	3
It’s fine to say to people, “You can decide what the good life is”, absolutely; autonomy, fine.	you don’t get round everything about what you should about welfare dependency and welfarism by just saying “Well I’m sorry, but I can’t deliver the revolution tomorrow.”	3
It’s not overwhelming	William Beveridge thought about having this two-tier system	3
we don’t want to blame them for that	Christianity is very ambivalent about money.	3
a lot of those investment bankers who have been pilloried haven’t been losing their clients	Owen seems to be finding every which way not to answer Anne's very sensible question	3
the reason banks take excessive risk is that they don’t pay the price for that risk-taking, because of the government guarantee	we need to think about, how we have a more paternalist system for people like that	3
and it’s fundamentally immoral	child tax credit is just like a much more generous version of child benefit	3
In a sense he’s very similar to the abolition of the Board and Lodgings Allowance that Margaret Thatcher brought in at the end of the ‘80s, which obviously saw a huge spike in rough sleeping	Owen's problem is that Owen will not say whether Owen finds it inherently undesirable or not, or that it leads to a situation which is very bad because it traps people	3
AM doesn't know what RS's solution would be if he didn’t go that way	in itself this is undesirable	3
that has become incredibly dangerous and insupportable	the young guy’d lost his job at Tesco	3
The difference is that this was an aberration	they are somehow or another demoralized and broken	3
it’s (to get in debt) quite morally neutral.	when people try to make a distinction between the deserving and the less deserving claimants, some people then kick up about it	3
if I have a child, I have to consider if I can afford the child	It’s a social issue, not a moral issue.	3
we’re talking here about families with children	there seemed to be a germ of compassion about what Neil was saying	3
The outside impetus is the equivalent of your spike in the steering wheel, and I think that’s necessary.	You wanted to provide for yourself	3
JL doesn’t buy that at all	that’s what social services have a responsibility to deal with	3
a country can even say, “We’re going to go bankrupt. It’s humiliating. We’ll do it. We’ll start again. We’ll grow	Yes, and even with these egregious examples of which I am the strongest possible critic, it is the case – because the system is still just about working – that trust and credit, and codes and mutuality and things like that still exist, to some extent.	3
The other is to say, “Morality is a form of human flourishing, which requires transformation of social conditions.”	AM is not in the same way	3
where First witness and CF kind of wanted to talk about economic policy they would have agreed on a lot of things	Sometimes people just want to have more children, even if they can’t afford them	3
in order to finance the trade and the extraction of resource in African countries, infrastructure was built and there was a degree of benevolence	incentives are irrelevant	3
this is a live debate	it’s almost as though people won’t take account of the fact they’ve got absolutely no money	3
What we do need to think about, are people’s incentives, and how you set up people’s incentives in the right way, that people do the right things	Justice would be multi-facetted	3
That surely is the challenge	that is fair	3
‘The Daily Telegraph’ pointed out there are 23 people chasing every job in this country	JL's actually financing lifestyles that people can’t actually afford	3
the State is already helping them	We’re talking hundreds, if not thousands, of per cent	3
there are lots of other people who are lenders too	there’s a demand of equal concern that the State has for everyone, such that if these interventions are not working for the most needy cases	3
the context for the atrocities having been carried out by agents of the British Government at the time, the context was the atrocities being carried out against them by the Mau Mau	their risk is really with the government, and whether the government will intervene	3
there’s the rub	Cameron’s concerns resonate with perhaps the majority	3
MT's got all the information there in front of him	And the problem is, as we have things at the moment, with inflation so high and interest rates at rock bottom, savers are seeing their money taken away from them	3
Mr Cameron was perfectly within his rights to raise that	there is a very important moral issue here,	3
Nothing good happened under Nazism	the welfare state system is creating a whole class of work shy, people who are incentivised not to work	3
Cameron has / has not a point	if the welfare state did not exist and you became unemployed, and you rely on your friends and family to get by, and then someone comes along and offers you a job but it doesn’t give you more money than your family and friends are going. We would still expect you to take that job	3
it’s only the right to a job that RS’d accept	both money and debt are essentially morally neutral	3
that is not irresponsible	incentives are irrelevant	3
people who grow up in very difficult families don’t run a risk of being difficult themselves	In a sense he’s very similar to the abolition of the Board and Lodgings Allowance that Margaret Thatcher brought in at the end of the ‘80s, which obviously saw a huge spike in rough sleeping	3
the guilt must be on the side of the colonial power	Michael Portillo is a saver / a debtor	3
we will find troubled families	that was a political strategy, a way of covering things up	3
who spend their Christmases manning soup kitchens.	Investment banks historically haven’t invested in training their management, and that’s a real problem.	3
most people put more effort into choosing the coffee shop that they buy their coffee from than which bank they put their life savings in	it keeps them happy	3
nearly two million people t working tax credit, which means that they are in jobs which are so badly paid that they can’t survive, that they require benefits	KM said nothing of the sort	3
I think a lot of people would like to reject their bank, but they find it practically difficult to do so	when black people say, for example, Jews control the banks, that's prejudice	3
if you get into debt, and you can never get out of it, that’s slavery	The thing that is most frustrating is that, and in fact a number of witnesses worried about over dependence on the State.	3
savers have lost out	people who don’t work, who are unemployed, are depressed.	3
what you need to do is get in there, intervene in families where there is this misery, and do the best you can.	some people are not working because they can make a penny more from giving up their job and living at home	3
the CSJ has for years now looked at social reform across a number of areas	there was horror at Mau Mau.	3
it’s not necessarily solely a moral question	she is trying to do something about children- the whole scheme is trying to do that	3
that goes to the point that actually this is why these cases are significant	people are not naturally work shy	3
My concern is  that we now see people as though they’re going to replicate and reproduce.	the cost of bank borrowing doesn’t rise as the bank gets riskier	3
that is a good case and something AM does take very seriously	there is no statute of limitations	3
that’s a judgment that one might have	Claire would be all for reforming the welfare system and education	3
what SR doesn't want to see is a return necessarily to debtors’ prison	that’s actually coming down as a cohort effect anyway	3
By the 50s, the Empire is going	there is a deep moral instinct which says that the whole business of lending and borrowing is a highly moral area, or, if you like, a dangerous moral area	3
borrowing can be a wise choice for individuals	“Split up, don’t form couples”	3
there's no statute of limitations for murder	JB doesn't start from that position	3
You need laws that redefine what banking is	we could move some of that money around so it’s less for not working and more for going into work, and supporting those people who are trying hard on low wages, and who we want to see succeed	3
William Beveridge thought about having this two-tier system	I think Christianity has still not got its head around making money.	3
In a sense he’s very similar to the abolition of the Board and Lodgings Allowance that Margaret Thatcher brought in at the end of the ‘80s, which obviously saw a huge spike in rough sleeping	credit advertising is highly regulated	3
even if this hearing itself or the damages claims by these three individuals are concerned, it should / should not be the occasion for examining the colonial legacy	yes you can have a different structure for the industry, but you end up back with investment banks.	3
You’ve got no capacity.	it seems to be odd that JW talks about culture so much, and doesn’t refer to the cultural norms that are created by the dominance of those models	3
Ethics relies upon, in some sense, hierarchy; some hierarchical authority, and in some sense a social purpose. But actually, neither of those things exist in investment banks	you are stretching your definition in order to make the British Empire fit into that?	3
both money and debt are essentially morally neutral	thrift and prudence are virtues	3
Thousands were made landless, homeless and reduced to absolute poverty	The thing that is most frustrating is that, and in fact a number of witnesses worried about over dependence on the State.	3
families don't really have much agency themselves	The State can never really be neutral though,	3
they are right about that	that hints to the kind of schism around citizenship that we have here in the United Kingdom	3
People talk about abuse at the same time as talking about getting kids to school on time, at the same time as talking about them not eating the right kind of food and not reading to their kids	that’s what William Beveridge wanted when he was designing the welfare state	3
they have to look at the interests of the child, and to have a debate about the environment in which you bring children into the world	That’s not individualism	3
it can be dangerous, and particularly for the most vulnerable	there’s the rub	3
it’s these broader circumstances that we really need to get to the nub of	this actually has a fine tradition elsewhere	3
to concentrate simply on the individual, and his or her response, as opposed to the context of their lives, is immoral.	they are lenders	3
what we need is more houses	Owen has answered Anne's question	3
he was rather flattering about the virtue of putting off making buying decisions until you can actually afford it, which is a very old-fashioned virtue	Anne and Ruth agree that there are some troubled families	3
thrift and prudence are not virtues	They’re both trouble to those within their family, particularly their children, and their and those around them	3
we all know people who will tell you about some terribly wretched childhood that they’ve had	it’s been pointed out that borrowing money can have disadvantages, as well as advantages	3
the wider context is the colonial dispossession	it’s a problem that the sense of individual self-reliance, and standing on your own two feet and actually doing everything to avoid taking money from the state because you want to be politically independent and morally and individually independent has been sapped away at, chipped away at by the growth of welfarsim	3
If we live in a society where you get kudos for having just a whole lot of money, then people will pursue that	it is the equivalent of calling people feckless and lazy to say that a lot of young people today have become so dependent in a passive way on somebody else sorting things out for them, that they do say “Why should I take that job? I don’t want to get up that early.”	3
that's a hang up Britain has got	if you haven’t had that template then you can’t	3
MT has got to look at the underlying economic incentives	you start again with some very strict rules and a stigma.	3
there are not very specific perpetrators	that form of capitalism wasn’t generating sufficient surpluses	3
You wanted to provide for yourself	we should be very circumspect in the way we intervene in families,	3
the Government seems to be targeting only the poor for intervention	These things lead to poverty	3
xxx is how JB regards it	Ethics relies upon, in some sense, hierarchy; some hierarchical authority, and in some sense a social purpose. But actually, neither of those things exist in investment banks	3
People have a moral duty to work to support themselves	MB's been reading it too	3
unemployment is a crime not a personal tragedy	if you get into debt, and you can never get out of it, that’s slavery	3
in itself this is undesirable	we’re talking about the general sort of, philosophical underpinning of this.	3
we do look back to the fact that people were making stirring speeches about it at the time	justice would look like xxx	3
CF is worried about this debate leading to the pathologising of feckless behaviour by individuals, rather than a more balanced discussion.	everything can just carry on	3
If Ruth's not wholly opposed to it, she finds xxx so objectionable that Louise Casey’s offering	the reason that so many people have defaulted on their mortgages is not the result of tens of thousands of random decisions by individuals	3
JL's industry wants to comply with the regulations that others have determined. Not just in the UK, but in the whole of the EU	these companies, in their marketing departments, sit down and say to themselves, “When we’re advertising our products, we should make sure that consumers really, really, really understand what they’re getting in for”?  / they sit down and think, “How can we get customers to buy our products, by putting in the shop window the most generous possible figures in the hope that they won’t understand that that’s just an offer to lure them in”?	3
This took place in the colonial era	I think one interesting thing to look at is difference between the adverts that investment banks for clients in things like The Economist or The Financial Times, which say that they’re all about innovation and client service, and then the values that they espouse internally. Particularly during annual reviews, where what they’re after is people who are about making money, and are committed to making money for the firm.	3
witnesses don't have an answer to that	ND must stop attacking them and actually suggest that we want the rich to do something productive	3
SR didn’t mean to say that, if it came across as that, at all	even if this hearing itself or the damages claims by these three individuals are concerned, it should / should not be the occasion for examining the colonial legacy	3
it is not	relative to many other countries surely it's an exemplar of inclusivity	3
there is a no utopia	The way Neil would describe a lot of the people Neil's met who have been long term unemployed is kind of defeated, kind of depressed	3
If you take the classic Louise Casey situation: a mother, serially deprived, not been parented herself, can’t look after her child, the child is truanting, the child’s getting into crime, the mother has mental health problems, the mother is abused, non-domination has nothing do with it	they need help getting back on track	3
they’ll be the first, often, to admit they need a lot of help.	JB wants to get rid of the welfare state, the welfare system	3
if you were a Martian, and you descended and looked at what’s going on at the moment, the first thing you would say is that the lenders are being under-rewarded, not that the borrowers are being fleeced.	that help should be very carefully calibrated, to restore the capacity for independence and personal responsibility	3
Claire has no answer to Neil's complaint that our market in housing has seriously distorted the housing benefit	it’s fair	3
there are many examples in society where these codes of proper conduct have continued	that is totally untrue	3
That's not good enough	rich countries in the West occupying countries of other people and imposing their rule on them and generally speaking extracting various forms of wealth from those countries to benefit the host country	3
that takes ES xxx	that’s where we can start asking the questions	3
these families, and the problems they face, have many causes, complicated, springing from social structures, cultural attitudes, all sorts of things	There is a problem with judging the past by our values	3
the big issue here is where the boundary should lie between the family and the State; how much the State should be allowed to, interfere is value laden, intervene.	If we’re returning to the notion of the deserving and the undeserving poor, xxx happens to the children of the undeserving	3
there’s a danger when you kind of say, “The poor are the ones who suffer. The rich are the bad guys.”	the CSJ has for years now looked at social reform across a number of areas	3
it was something like 16% of sub-prime borrowers didn’t even make a first payment	when it reduces by 90%- what Neil meant is that they were all in low paid, part time jobs	3
KM's not in this business	that would not reduce the amount we spend on housing benefit	3
Over a million people, young people, without work, it has a scarring impact	it all changed when xxx	3
In the old days of early capitalism, bankers were famously prudent people	what’s happened is, there’s been a huge and permanent increase in the number of people who are unemployed	3
that’s what’s trying to be addressed here.	we’ve stopped thinking of morality as something continuous, something that permeates your whole life, your whole work.	3
people who grow up in very difficult families don’t run a risk of being difficult themselves	This idea that you know, if your mother didn’t love you or you had a terrible background – sometimes the children, the daughters of those families become the most wonderful, careful mothers precisely as a reaction.	3
I'm not saying that	the cost of bank borrowing doesn’t rise as the bank gets riskier	3
and we ought to do the right thing	we do need to get back to this idea of desert	3
The interest rate varies by the amount of the charge for the credit but also the time over which you repay it	children can be vulnerable to domination to their parents	3
they will have experienced a drop of 10% overall in their living standards	The system itself is not intrinsically corrupt; it’s just a few bad apples who can be dealt with by tweaking the rules.	3
And if you suppress it, then in fact you're in a situation where the wealth that you look like you're generating is fool’s gold, not real wealth at all.	what is happening is that this is a small number of social work clients, 120,000	3
he was rather flattering about the virtue of putting off making buying decisions until you can actually afford it, which is a very old-fashioned virtue	the problem is that welfarism has gone far beyond a safety net, or anything compassionate	3
we will find troubled families	In terms of moral responsibility then it, is pretty much anything allowed to them because it was a struggle of liberation	3
that argument is even stronger if the people you’re relying on are not your friends and family, but other people you don’t even know	It’s a social issue, not a moral issue.	3
it is a claim for compensation against the present government, which had no responsibility for what happened	That’s how JB regards it	3
It’s often kind of guilt money coming out	there’s certainly an argument to look at re-introducing a contributory principle back in to welfare. Something like the French system where if you lose your job you get 70% of your previous wage for a limited period	3
one of the jobs that the welfare system is quite reputably there to do, is to try and encourage the best of people, and to encourage the best that they can do	I think the interesting thing is that banks do have codes of ethics, but to the extent they have them they are incredibly disappointing, if not total crap.	3
we’ve seen millions of people claiming incapacity benefit, being dependent on benefits, young people have a sense of entitlement from the state, rather than a sense of self-reliance	That’s how JB regards it	3
it’s part of an industrial strategy for them to do that	part of the problem is the distinction people have drawn between the State and society.	3
if you listen both to Government spokespeople and the Prime Minister himself plus a lot of the media, you would think that all of the troubled families that they’re talking about are in a lot of trouble.	JW is a Marxist	3
we shouldn’t be too optimistic there that we can develop regulation that makes banks change their cultures	I believe this is capable of reform if we introduce codes, if we stigmatise bad behaviour, if we set about within organisations making sure the codes are adhered to.	3
What is wrong with what she is doing is that she is presenting that tiny minority of troubled families as typical of the poor	this is a live debate	3
we could move some of that money around so it’s less for not working and more for going into work, and supporting those people who are trying hard on low wages, and who we want to see succeed	we do not have got a lot to apologize for	3
I'm not saying that	it’s the poor who suffer	3
debt that actually goes to something that’s productive, and actually helps, is to be encouraged. 	individual faith is not strong enough	3
they don’t fit certain characteristics, such as for example, serial fatherlessness.	the figures are a moral issue	3
A good chunk of the world did notice the boom times that developed countries had.	they are somehow or another demoralized and broken	3
we are forced to do the analysis	there are other things that the taxpayers get back from the welfare state.	3
they actually want help,	we’ll not further entrench the type of poverty	3
the household has a low income	she was helping them manage their resources.	3
I'm not saying that	The trains ran on crime	3
the State is already helping them	It is a safety net	3
we haven’t actually done as much as we could have done	that is what the Government’s trying to get hold of	3
one thing KM may not be aware of is just how much benefits have been cut already by inflation	Yes, and even with these egregious examples of which I am the strongest possible critic, it is the case – because the system is still just about working – that trust and credit, and codes and mutuality and things like that still exist, to some extent.	3
terrible harm it’s done	you can’t separate morals from practice	3
If it were politically possible, JB would / would not want to abolish the welfare state altogether	the welfare state, as it is, is a safety net / is a trap	3
they reflect the standards of business generally	CL would feel better if the people who had suffered that injustice were compensated	3
people like KM who believe as a utopia, are precisely the ones who have led to bad policies and bad results.	ES has just muddled up civil and criminal cases	3
Owen seems to be finding every which way not to answer Anne's very sensible question	they want the relationships that go with work	3
if Britain thinks that it can move on to an inclusive citizenship without addressing these historical relics of colonialism that continue to plague contemporary debates about citizenship then frankly it's fooling itself	this activity is not taking advantage of people in a moment of great weakness	3
it is / is not right in its strategy for tackling it	there are two different ways of improving the incentives to work	3
It's only for Esther colonialism that is on trial here, not the behaviour of the insurgents at the time	the point about a welfare state is it was set up as a safety net, during a time of near full employment	3
that’s where we can start asking the questions	it’s judgemental	3
Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	If we live in a society where you get kudos for having just a whole lot of money, then people will pursue that	3
what is happening is that this is a small number of social work clients, 120,000	the welfare state system is creating a whole class of work shy, people who are incentivised not to work	3
It’s been done to them, not done by them	The system itself is not intrinsically corrupt; it’s just a few bad apples who can be dealt with by tweaking the rules.	3
all that you need is a kind of credit based consumer thing	It’s not coercive at all	3
we need both debt and savings	it doesn't really answer why there was such outrage about it	3
there's no statute of limitations for murder	In every walk of life what really work, even in the economy, is when you negotiate what is reciprocally in your joint interests	3
it is the knock down argument	Liberal societies have often known that the family can be a nexus for forms of unequal opportunity	3
one of the things that RS picked up when he was listening in the green room was about this idea of this demoralisation	the growth of what Claire calls ‘welfarism’ is to do with, firstly the disappearance of so many skilled middle income jobs; and secondly due to the failure to build social housing	3
evidence shows that those who are in poverty are more likely to be facing all of these other forms of disadvantage	you are stretching your definition in order to make the British Empire fit into that?	3
CF doesn’t know	one of the groups of people who were kind of interested in thrift and prudence were early productive capitalists, who established the capitalist system	3
We're looking at this case in a multiple ways	there are 5 million people on the waiting list for social housing	3
What we need to do to deal with poverty is to do something about the 2 million children who live in poverty	they are not	3
Owen is the champion of the working class	a high proportion of people are desperate to work, that work on such low wages that they have to have benefits in order to top them up	3
that majority doesn't include CL	we’ll not further entrench the type of poverty	3
there’s some political rhetoric flying around that CG would not choose to be using.	it is the equivalent of calling people feckless and lazy to say that a lot of young people today have become so dependent in a passive way on somebody else sorting things out for them, that they do say “Why should I take that job? I don’t want to get up that early.”	3
it would be wonderful if politicians could just snap their fingers and create millions of jobs	it was something like 16% of sub-prime borrowers didn’t even make a first payment	3
it is a good point Clifford makes	they found that 11% of people who were on benefits said that they felt fully justified being on benefits and have discovered that life without the added complication of work has much to recommend it	3
the knowledge is bounded	if we’re in a Liberal society, as opposed to a Republican society, we might care about the principal of neutrality;	3
Britain is actually very unusual compared to other countries	You may have more or less of it, the scale may shift, the relativities may shift, but you do have poverty to deal with.	3
If that’s the kind of job system that Neil wants, it seems to be a deeply immoral way of dealing with the quest of work, and how people should look at work	The problem isn’t lack of employment	3
one that ought to, at least to some extent, be resurrected	They're negligent	3
state intervention only seems to be coercive state intervention in the lives and families of the poor	CL's no more sympathetic to economic determinism, or the idea that poverty creates this than anything else.	3
there’s a danger when you kind of say, “The poor are the ones who suffer. The rich are the bad guys.”	Unfortunately I just don’t think we can get away from the inherent complexity here, which is that rules can sometimes be good things and they can sometimes be bad things, but so can social norms	3
It creates a dependency on work	Claire is nervous	3
they are choosing to borrow small amounts of money for short periods of time	ND must stop attacking them and actually suggest that we want the rich to do something productive	3
And the problem is, as we have things at the moment, with inflation so high and interest rates at rock bottom, savers are seeing their money taken away from them	Investment bankers work very hard for their clients; they provide a lot of intellectual input and a lot of intellectual stimulus for the economy as a whole. They provide some positives as well.	3
What is actually happening is that people are choosing to pay down their long-term debt, their credit cards and their bank loans	these are banking reforms, they’re not moral	3
if Ruth keeps going like that, we won’t find any at all	Over a million people, young people, without work, it has a scarring impact	3
you can see an observable reality, is that families exist who are trouble	the desire to work is innate	3
The number of people that fall in the category that the 120,000 comes from, has been falling since 2004	the urge to get a job is overwhelming	3
Rules are what determine morality	only since the welfare state has there been permanent unemployment	3
families don't really have much agency themselves	there is a serious banking issue, yes	3
that majority doesn't include CL	the banks are the lenders	3
by hitching society’s wellbeing to free market Capitalism we’ve made a pact with the devil we can’t get out of	in itself there is / is not a danger there	3
the current debate is about deflecting debate from those failures onto the supposed moral fecklessness of individuals	that’s a big moral problem	3
we need both debt and savings	it’s these other areas, these increasing interventions that Claire is interested in	3
That is the essentially unjust element in this whole transaction	there is a no utopia	3
it will be an important opportunity for the individuals to make their case	You would think that you were imposing a kind of domination on your neighbors if you were just behaving very badly, and making everybody’s lives a misery around you	3
that does seem to correspond to the reality	MB's been reading it too	3
MT would adopt a more kind of quasi Marxist position	the household has a low income	3
JL's industry should not need to be wrapped up in red tape	Really horrible things might have happened to them	3
that undermines the whole argument that you make about incentives	it very much depends which side you take it,	3
MP and RL’re talking here about poor people being moral agents,	we might for instance want banks to split and to ring fence retail banking from high risk investment for instance	3
if you wanted to pay to work and to create a culture of work, it might be useful to have work in the first place, to have proper jobs at proper wages in the first place	There’s no discipline there	3
If there is an element of retrospective moral judgments, there are no problem with that	families have low income	3
they will only do it if they are regulated	if you wanted to pay to work and to create a culture of work, it might be useful to have work in the first place, to have proper jobs at proper wages in the first place	3
you can get people to effectively adapt to the conditions in which they live	If they take risks with their own money and they can lose their own money, then that’s absolutely fine.	3
MB's been reviewing it.	that's not correct	3
there are survivors, who have never experienced any form of recompense	The thing that is most frustrating is that, and in fact a number of witnesses worried about over dependence on the State.	3
this has somehow changed it to focusing on the individual behaviour	In terms of moral responsibility then it, is pretty much anything allowed to them because it was a struggle of liberation	3
the idea that people should take any job at any wages, any conditions is an immoral position to take	Dutch bankers have to take an oath	3
consumers should have all the information that they need	It seems to be a mixture of arrogance and absurdity	3
anyone’s saying it should be two, or three, and that’s the limit	we only saw riots last year with young people saying “Why shouldn’t I have this? Why shouldn’t I have that?”	3
That’s AB's sort of neutrality	as part of that programme, Helen would say that Helen does have a remit to ask parents to consider what having another child would mean for them, and to get them to consider the opportunities for contraception	3
the State has taken a moral position	I think it’s more a matter of trying to shape	3
we have a huge problem with unemployment	this argument as benefits somehow taking people out of jobs, or disincentivising people simply doesn’t work	3
credit advertising is highly regulated	that would be great	3
it is imbued with geography, history and culture	In Hammersmith, Fulham, Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster, which is a tri-borough consortium, they were given the target of 1720 families out of the 120,000	3
My concern is  that we now see people as though they’re going to replicate and reproduce.	that is not a particularly moral position to take	3
You talk about greed; people are indeed very angry about large bankers bonuses.	If somebody’s not willing to reward you by borrowing your savings, there’s no point doing the saving.	3
the system seems to be very, very heavily weighted against them.	People are no more stupid now than they were 150 years ago	3
MB's been reviewing it.	that does undermine the moral fibre of a country	3
we cannot take away the fact that these were people who were simply fighting to reclaim their lost lands	it’s compulsion	3
terrible harm it’s done	if you look at the figures, fatherlessness, family breakdown, is disproportionately represented in all these social problems. 	3
It very much depends on the specific incident you are talking about and which side are you going to go on?	they are pushing	3
these are elderly victims	the first and third witnesses didn't seem to draw much a distinction between the British Empire and the Third Reich.	3
it is a claim for compensation against the present government, which had no responsibility for what happened	there’s no realistic consideration, or real world consideration	3
Kenyan cannot just do little policy bits to get Kenan off the argument	We’d still be much better off	3
Sometimes people just want to have more children, even if they can’t afford them	AM shouldn't go all ‘Fifty Shades of Grey'	3
they are surely to be presumed to be capable of being helped in a way that allows them to live independent lives.	we should be very circumspect in the way we intervene in families,	3
the State has taken a moral position	it’s much more likely	3
Some of the people who are doing these wonderful things, and show that they value things in life well beyond money, are also somehow running these really crooked organisation	terrible harm it’s done	3
The system itself is not intrinsically corrupt; it’s just a few bad apples who can be dealt with by tweaking the rules.	if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on	3
people can be tempted out of work	credit raises living standards	3
if you get it slightly wrong you cause yourself a major problem, and you have the Office of Fair Trading on your back straight away, as is happening now with some leaders	this is quite a tricky discussion	3
James made this very clear – James wasn’t blaming individuals	They do bear responsibility.	3
They do bear responsibility.	we have a huge problem with unemployment.	3
some of the world is suffering from the impact of development on climate change, for example.	it is reasonable to argue that given what they went through, as the closest they can get to the people who perpetrated this is the British state, indeed the state benefitted from colonialism in a variety of ways, it's reasonable that they should seek recompense from the British state	3
it’s a very good point, Clifford’s just put Clifford's finger on it, about the fourth undeserving child or however many you want to put on the State’s payroll	the problem with freedom is it’s become a cuckoo value	3
They’re completely negligent in this area	It’s very difficult to parent well in those circumstances.	3
when you classify people as terrorists then you are seeking to dehumanise them	There are three people who it seems very likely suffered	3
they are right about that	that helps perpetuate a very nasty culture within some of the banks	3
they're being misled	poverty is the driver of events	3
When people either knowingly, or unknowingly, get into a position where they simply cannot service the debt. And that’s where the problems start arising	every intellectual, left and right, everybody went along with it	3
This is a very interesting point.	if we’re going to discuss morality, we have to discuss the immorality of political leaders.	3
you start again with some very strict rules and a stigma.	the idea that people should take any job at any wages, any conditions is an immoral position to take	3
one of the things that RS picked up when he was listening in the green room was about this idea of this demoralisation	it was quite old legislation	3
the value of your savings is likely to be periodically inflated away	in almost any jurisdiction in the world it would be seen as a crime	3
this means nothing	they're easily seduced into acting, in the short-term, in ways which aren’t very good for them in the long-term	3
that is totally untrue	It’s not overwhelming	3
They have absolutely very little choice except to take the terms that are being offered to them	people are taking on too much debt because xxx	3
people should do xxx in a place like Merthyr Tydfil	JL's industry should simply be ethical	3
Anne tried to push AB on that	the household has a low income	3
It’s actually rather immoral to come up with this kind of structurally derived argument that says, “Your job is really – or our job, collectively – is just to say to people ‘we will not put up with these situations and encourage political action’”.	there’s nothing necessarily positive about saving	3
all that you need is a kind of credit based consumer thing	There’s no free education	3
I think one interesting thing to look at is difference between the adverts that investment banks for clients in things like The Economist or The Financial Times, which say that they’re all about innovation and client service, and then the values that they espouse internally. Particularly during annual reviews, where what they’re after is people who are about making money, and are committed to making money for the firm.	that is a source of injustice	3
the big underlying moral problem with a debt-based free market economy is that when it goes bad, as it does tend to do, it’s always the poor that gets the blame	there are lots of other people who are lenders too	3
there’s parents with mental health problems who have lost their ability to care for their children	it depends on what basis you think they need it, and why	3
money’s got to find somewhere	this means nothing	3
in terms of the morality of this, we have to be careful of stigmatising debt and remember the creative aspect of credit	black people can't be racist in the United Kingdom context	3
they’re not just playing with their own money	CF's definitely more in debt	3
That’s given us everything from sewage and welfare and trains, to museums and orchestras.	their particular problems were entirely resultant of the circumstances in which they found themselves	3
what the Government is getting at, is that if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on.	it keeps them happy	3
when you have incumbent governments, and they see that consumer credit boom mushrooming and mushrooming, they do xxx	underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you’ll be paying all sorts of charges	3
AM doesn't know what RS's solution would be if he didn’t go that way	in terms of the case of these individuals they have a perfect right to pursue the claim that they are making and it is reasonable for the British state, even though today's politicians weren't implicated in this, for the British state to be answerable of the actions of the British state in the past, in this specific case	3
The State can provide information, guidance, and assistance on a voluntary basis.	there are other things that the taxpayers get back from the welfare state.	3
Giles thinks that the banking industry, the City of London and Capitalism are upsetting and immoral.	the young guy wasn’t turning up to work on time	3
this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	JB wants to get rid of the welfare state, the welfare system	3
it’s not particularly attractive	that goes to the point that actually this is why these cases are significant	3
If you look at these things, as anyone in work would look at, if you can’t afford to have children the State should not step in and say “Unconditionally, we will support you if you make the decision to have children you can’t afford”	that’s dangerous	3
We’re talking hundreds, if not thousands, of per cent	the colonial context is absent	3
there’s some very virtuous people who work in the City of London and do extraordinarily good things with their money.	JA has heard lots of judgments of people being found guilty of uttering racially offensive remarks without themselves being what JA would call a card carrying racist	3
In the old days of early capitalism, bankers were famously prudent people	we’ve got ourselves into a complete mess in defining who troubled families are	3
it would not be okay under these circumstances for, say, a holocaust victim to take a civil damages case against Angela Merkel	One of the confusing things in Britain is that actually the overwhelming majority of what we call ‘tax credits’, about 30 of the £33bn a year we spend on them is actually spent on stuff that’s actually not at all linked to being in work	3
there’s been a transfer	you would be intervening	3
a legal remedy exists	we should be very circumspect in the way we intervene in families,	3
they are on the whole, probably not PhDs in economics	It may be that it’s a perfectly decent product	3
There is no evidence that that’s going to work	We still defer to the Queen	3
young people should go out and get something from the world, contribute something to the world. Instead of saying “Why can’t I get a well paid job? Why can’t I get a house?”	what we need much more is a sense of reciprocity that it’s not just that my interest happens to coincide with yours.	3
it’s, as it were, intellectually honest to kind of play out the virtues of saving, as opposed to borrowing, when really, unless the two kind of balance out in an economy, there’s no point saving	it’s particularly morally repugnant for the State to tell us who should and shouldn’t have children	3
borrowers should not be doing badly	there is a deep moral instinct which says that the whole business of lending and borrowing is a highly moral area, or, if you like, a dangerous moral area	3
We have a minimum wage	there are many forms of state intervention	3
a Liberal society has an absolute moral duty to go and help those people, especially the child	It’s not overwhelming	3
it is / is not moral to ask people to work in a job that doesn’t really pay them that much more than being on benefits	We have a minimum wage	3
The origin of the word ‘credit’ is the Latin ‘Credere’ – to believe.	There is lots of research been done to how cultures are being changed; it’s very difficult, but one things is very clear: if there is something rotten at the top, there is no hope for reform at the bottom	3
you have to come up with a moral response to it.	in terms of the case of these individuals they have a perfect right to pursue the claim that they are making and it is reasonable for the British state, even though today's politicians weren't implicated in this, for the British state to be answerable of the actions of the British state in the past, in this specific case	3
this is the moral maze	that’s a big moral problem	3
A kind of parental determinism emerges that’s overly fatalistic as well	What is actually happening is that people are choosing to pay down their long-term debt, their credit cards and their bank loans	3
they don’t have the security of future income that they did have before the credit crisis	It gives a very strong impression that you can borrow with impunity	3
sometimes taking out credit can also help you not be dependent.	that is a not a bad thing	3
And the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items.	CF doesn’t know	3
what this needs is not simply us putting moral blame on one side or the other, but actually putting moral blame on a set of economic policies and political decisions that have led to credit liberalisation.	the problem is that many people, either knowingly or because credit cards were being thrust at them, have taken on debts they can’t possibly hope to pay	3
you often have public inquiries and open investigations	NL thinks xxx	3
the argument that Anne was raising “Let’s not talk about externalities, let’s talk about internalities” as it were, misses the point	Ruth would do xxx about it	3
if you borrow some money from me, and you pay it back very quickly, the interest rate will be much higher than if you pay it back over a long period	black people can't be racist in the United Kingdom context	3
It doesn't presuppose a God	they are not	3
they’ve over broadened their remit over recent years	No that’s not possible, but that’s not something we should try to aim at	3
I welcomed them to the Church actually	whatever about papering over the cracks of inequality, it certainly was papering over the weakness of the productive economy	3
they're in debt	Debt is used time and again as a set of economic decisions, and political decisions, to achieve certain things in society	3
I think there needs to be a broad based ethical obligation on board,	you are on the side of the nationalist movements which replaced the British Empire	3
These are children  on the threshold of being taken away to live in care	the idea of ‘the’ problem family is a useful invention that’s been used again and again to police the poor, and to place the blame for social problems on individuals	3
at no time before the welfare state, was there mass permanent unemployment	there’s a risk.	3
They did see this as being like under the Third Reich in effect.	if Melanie's referring to the problem of absent fathers as a source of poverty and deprivation amongst these troubled families, which are really troubling families. If she's talking about that, then of course there’s issues around the justice of a man’s behavior towards a woman which can raise issues of domination	3
It doesn’t expect that if you have a false set of structures, or a false set of purposes, that everything will be fine if you just have very good individuals	these terms ‘deserving’ or ‘undeserving’ are not particularly helpful	3
Humans flourish on recognition, social recognition	Nothing good happened under Nazism	3
MT would adopt a more kind of quasi Marxist position	We’d still be much better off	3
there are families with problems	James and Neil’re not just welfare rangers, though they are welfare rangers	3
they will only do it if they are regulated	“Split up, don’t form couples”	3
they’ll be the first, often, to admit they need a lot of help.	the economy is in such a terrible state that in order to expand the economy, and get us out of this crisis, we have to encourage people to borrow.	3
you can see an observable reality, is that families exist who are trouble	CF doesn’t know	3
we’ve thought too much, funnily, about the financial incentives to work, and not enough about the conditionality in the system	There is a problem with judging the past by our values	3
I get loans pushed on me all the time	it’s quite striking that all three witnesses, coming from very different positions, put their finger on that	3
What's happening in this case is not the prosecution of a crime	last year 93% of new claimants were in a household in which somebody worked	3
continuing to intervene, not pausing.	one of the problems we’re facing now is the fact that organisations, and indeed people who require debt, that what we’re doing is rolling everything over	3
That is the real lived experience of ordinary working class people	we’re here to discuss the morality	3
it shouldn't be stigmatised to get into debt at all	that does seem to correspond to the reality	3
I think individualism may be the way forward	the trouble with both Kantian and utilitarian morality is it only happens sometimes, we need to get back to the classics.	3
I think it’s more a matter of trying to shape	they’re very short-term loans	3
you can’t say saving is morally good necessarily	I think one interesting thing to look at is difference between the adverts that investment banks for clients in things like The Economist or The Financial Times, which say that they’re all about innovation and client service, and then the values that they espouse internally. Particularly during annual reviews, where what they’re after is people who are about making money, and are committed to making money for the firm.	3
Owen's problem is that Owen will not say whether Owen finds it inherently undesirable or not, or that it leads to a situation which is very bad because it traps people	that’s a judgment that one might have	3
It doesn’t expect that if you have a false set of structures, or a false set of purposes, that everything will be fine if you just have very good individuals	And, in turn, the credit liberalisation was fuelled as a specific economic policy to paper over the cracks of inequality, as a result of other economic policies	3
in the end it’s culture not faith that might save us	the current debate is about deflecting debate from those failures onto the supposed moral fecklessness of individuals	3
the poor are in the most disadvantaged of all positions.	they should be tried	3
the welfare state system is creating a whole class of work shy, people who are incentivised not to work	I think the model of the ‘hidden hand’ has been vastly overplayed.	3
Owen wants to take housing benefit down	they find it hard to put the two at odds, and to understand that they ought to be leaning towards the common good and not towards personal and individual interest	3

we can do xxx to make JA happy	very often they do have responsibility for what they borrow	3
a Liberal society has an absolute moral duty to go and help those people, especially the child	that plays against Matthew's point	3
they have nowhere to go	the argument that Anne was raising “Let’s not talk about externalities, let’s talk about internalities” as it were, misses the point	3
this argument as benefits somehow taking people out of jobs, or disincentivising people simply doesn’t work	I think you exaggerate	3
black people can't be racist in the United Kingdom context	Investment banks are characterised by a culture which is just pure exultant, rampant individualism.	3
MB's been reading it too	there has to be a bottom line beyond which it turns into outright exploitation	3

Alexander shouldn't be so politically correct	I don’t think rules are totally primary	3
if the best way of making money is to encourage people to take out debts that they can’t afford, the best way to make money is to encourage people to take out mortgages they can’t afford, then that is what capitalism has reverted to	we spend about £20 billion as a nation on housing benefit	3
in the context of what we're talking about tonight the strange phenomenon then occurred, where the British went in denial and have been in denial ever since.	they were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of young people, desperate for work	3
we lack any sense of the common good	if the welfare state did not exist and you became unemployed, and you rely on your friends and family to get by, and then someone comes along and offers you a job but it doesn’t give you more money than your family and friends are going. We would still expect you to take that job	3
that is a moral position to take	the desire to work is innate	3
It’s meant to make a difference	The incidents of real ethical abuses, let alone criminal abuses, in investment banking is actually very small.	3
it wants to get people in those households into school, into work, out of crime. Changing the patterns of, sometimes, a lifetime	If Ruth's not wholly opposed to it, she finds xxx so objectionable that Louise Casey’s offering	3
and therefore the only way forward was for Britain to withdraw	There is a problem with judging the past by our values	3
the push is coming from the people with the money	If we don’t give more benefits, more welfare, we’re going to end up with homeless young people everywhere, destitution and so on	3
eighteen plus're kind of overgrown children	debt is morally neutral	3
as Centre for social justice's travelled around the poorest parts of the UK, Centre for social justice's seen consistently there are factors that make it much more likely that you will live in poverty and fail to reach potential you have as a human being	one that ought to, at least to some extent, be resurrected	3
My concern is  that we now see people as though they’re going to replicate and reproduce.	It creates a dependency on work	3
It’s what Ruth would think if Ruth lived next door	I think one interesting thing to look at is difference between the adverts that investment banks for clients in things like The Economist or The Financial Times, which say that they’re all about innovation and client service, and then the values that they espouse internally. Particularly during annual reviews, where what they’re after is people who are about making money, and are committed to making money for the firm.	3
It’s estimated 17% more children will fall into that group by 2015	Not at all	3
thrift is a perfectly sensible thing to do	My concern is  that we now see people as though they’re going to replicate and reproduce.	3

What is wrong with what she is doing is that she is presenting that tiny minority of troubled families as typical of the poor	her mother was so poorly parented	3
Boudewijn thinks there is no real banking problem, apart from a few rotten apples	I don’t mean to say that everybody within it concedes to that bad behaviour	3
there’s been a transfer	We’re offering things on a rewards based process, which is if the local government succeeds in achieving its results then it gets more money. If it doesn’t, it won’t.	3
JB wants to get rid of the welfare state, the welfare system	CL's not in debt at the moment	3
They’re far more likely as a result to be unemployed in later life	we do look back to the fact that people were making stirring speeches about it at the time	3
It is a very, very rough estimate of the number of families in 2004 which had 5 of 7 deprivations: no one is in work; overcrowded housing; parents have no qualifications; mother has mental health problems; at least one parent has long standing limiting illness, disability or infirmity; the family has a low income; and the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items	That led to new regulations in 2004, new regulations in 2006,	3
the State is already helping them	society benefits / suffers	3
bankruptcy used to be shameful	We’re pretending the problem isn’t there	3
the reality is that in the last ten or twenty years there’s been a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, and from the young to the old, and that what Neil's really trying to do is to justify that by blaming the poor for their position	a carrot and a stick approach to welfare state won't actually solve them	3
when rents are soaring, they can’t afford to pay their rent.	theres' nothing wrong with doing the British thing, owning up and paying up	3
My favourite story about that is Saint Francis of Assisi, who was so against money that he made his monks put a coin – if they got caught touching money they’d have to put a coin in their mouth and put it in a pile of dung, he hated money so much. But then when he died they build a huge great big expensive mausoleum for him on the top of the	it is not the equivalent of calling people feckless and lazy to say that a lot of young people have become so dependent that they say `Why should I take that job? I don't want to get up that early.''	3
you can be in a situation where you say, “We will let you write off your debts, without incurring moral hazard.”	rich countries in the West occupying countries of other people and imposing their rule on them and generally speaking extracting various forms of wealth from those countries to benefit the host country	3
this is a live debate	It can’t be shamed into good behaviour, or even punished into good behaviour.	3
it's not a very important thing to do	we aren't even facing up to the actual problem	3
the moral problem is that of how to provide incentives to get people off welfare, into work	you’re leaving out a good chunk of the world which is still sitting there in poverty and didn’t really notice the boom times that some of us had in the developed countries	3
This is just crude Marxism	if Ruth keeps going like that, we won’t find any at all	3
there’s some very virtuous people who work in the City of London and do extraordinarily good things with their money.	The welfare state that we have at the moment here lacks a sense of ‘just desert’	3
it wasn't	People talk about abuse at the same time as talking about getting kids to school on time, at the same time as talking about them not eating the right kind of food and not reading to their kids	3
JB likens it to a mouse trap which has a rather stale piece of cheese in it	CG is not taking the first notion of what morality is	3
I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	Melanie's talking about the de-incentivisation of marriage, on the basis that we can’t possibly talk about marriage as opposed to un-marriage	3
it is far better, a better form of intervention, to provide decent jobs and decent wages, affordable housing	in South Korea, in terms of how South Korean grew, it did incentivise saving, at certain times, by certain economic policies	3
to do that, and to present the problem of poverty as one of dysfunctional families who are antisocial and need to have their behaviour changed, is itself a moral issue	The poor don’t lack that any more than the rich.	3
we have xxx much legal responsibility for the actions of the past	debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt	3
debt that actually goes to something that’s productive, and actually helps, is to be encouraged. 	Melanie's talking about marriage	3
that’s slightly disingenuous	it is / is not right in its strategy for tackling it	3
Lawrence James doesn't really like this case	it’s difficult for savers to take the high moral ground	3
if you’ve got money you can get more money	it seems to be odd that JW talks about culture so much, and doesn’t refer to the cultural norms that are created by the dominance of those models	3
we cannot for legal reasons go into sort of identifying individuals	it’s moved the furthest away of any of the industrialised countries from a contributory system where what you’ve paid in is what you get out	3
what they declare is the following: they start their oath with saying “I declare that I will perform my duties as a banker with integrity and care, and I will consider carefully all the interests involved in the bank. The clients, the shareholders, the employees and the society in which the bank operates, and then there are five or six lines that continue	For decades, our children have been taught nothing other than the Empire was uniquely dreadful	3
the Hola circumstances and the shock did not change the public consciousness about ourselves as an imperial power,and realised it was morally unsustainable from then onwards	that is the moral way of getting people to pay their rent on time	3
he half did	By the 50s, the Empire is going	3
the situation in Kenya was a bloody dirty war	Some regulation might help	3
the reason Dante confined them to the lowest circle of hell is because they made a big profit at the expense of very poor people, which was widely regarded as shameful	ND must stop attacking them and actually suggest that we want the rich to do something productive	3
they have nowhere to go	Investment banks historically haven’t invested in training their management, and that’s a real problem.	3
You talk about greed; people are indeed very angry about large bankers bonuses.	she has been so poorly parented	3
we’ve thought too much, funnily, about the financial incentives to work, and not enough about the conditionality in the system	there’s some very virtuous people who work in the City of London and do extraordinarily good things with their money.	3
which is the supreme example of just that individualism and abstraction	this is about compassion, social justice, giving these families a chance and no longer writing them off and leaving them on a social scrapheap.	3

MP's both.	No, no. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with people making a profit	3
there's a streak that says, it was a pretty balanced account, there's nothing wrong with colonialism	that’s very dangerous to the solidarity, which civilization requires	3
they’ll be the first, often, to admit they need a lot of help.	we don’t allow them to say things which are misleading	3
JL's not financing lifestyles that people can't afford	evidence shows that those who are in poverty are more likely to be facing all of these other forms of disadvantage	3
they’re very short-term loans	the culture of irresponsibility, or recklessness, around finance has been created not by people’s stupidity	3
That means not simply looking at the individual, but to change the conditions and provide those sorts of conditions.	There’s 5 million people languishing on social housing waiting lists	3
Esther would look at the context	they are moral	3
the areas of their life you intervene on, in order to bring about change are xxx	Merthyr Tydfil, in Wales has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country	3
The people who lose money are the taxpayers	people would require the social context in which work happens	3
I think the relics of colonialism, racism and the current dystopia around in relation to people groping focus a kind of inclusive British citizenship that relieves them of the guilt of their - of the past, and opens up a vista of an inclusive future, actually relies on, to some extent, Britain having a truth and reconciliation moment,	there’s a risk.	3

since the Council of Nicaea, in 325, made usury illegal, and it stayed that way for about 1,200 years in Europe, there have been moral questions surrounding borrowing and lending	So it’s as if the State imposes on people the notion of the good life, rather than as citizens ourselves we work through what the good life is.	3
there are 5 million people on the waiting list for social housing	when it reduces by 90%- what Neil meant is that they were all in low paid, part time jobs	3
there’s a lack of investment in management training	lots of people are doing part time work	3
I'm not saying that	I might not take back from the National Health Service or from the welfare state, the things that I put in, the money that I put in through my tax	3
these terms ‘deserving’ or ‘undeserving’ are not particularly helpful	not all debt is bad	3
you must require them to work	the system seems to be very, very heavily weighted against them.	3
it was a freedom struggle	it’s requirement	3
they will take no responsibility for society	they’re not going to do it on their own	3

we need both debt and savings	There is no simple way out of these kinds of dilemmas	3
I think investment banking is basically necessary.	they are on the edges or actually committing crime	3
If we want to live in a Liberal society that is also tolerant, we must have a set of principles that we all digest and understand, that ground and explain, and justify why we behave as we do	there are families that are so troubled that family intervention programmes are appropriate.	3

we are getting to the point where debt is simply going out of control	what we need to do to deal with poverty is to deal with problem families	3
At this current time, the current context without social housing, with 5 million people on social housing waiting lists, people - of course they should claim housing benefit, if they are unable to pay what are extortionate rents. Particularly in places like London	It doesn't presuppose a God	3
it’s not appropriate to use the market here.	they can’t get full time work	3
it wants to get people in those households into school, into work, out of crime. Changing the patterns of, sometimes, a lifetime	they can afford to sort it out themselves	3
they suffered in the context of imprisonment possibly	if you want the moral hazard, instead of kind of just going on about the bankers, there is a danger that if we just said we’d write off debt, that it actually isn’t very helpful for our side, for ordinary people, to actually have that	3
we do have a moral duty to intervene quite robustly in that situation	this cost is forced onto them	3
you can help them get back on their feet and able to parent their children effectively	she didn’t want any focus where it really counts for an awful lot of people, which is what’s going on around them.	3
These things lead to poverty	you’d not use that argument to explain the reason, for example, why we have an increase in obesity, and claim that the supermarkets are exploiting people’s desire for food	3
JB: did not take adversarial position towards the poor unfortunate people who’ve been trapped in the trap	there are two other brackets that I would bring within the troubled family scenario	3

there’s a lack of investment in management training	that takes ES xxx	3
it's not innate	Investment banks are characterised by a culture which is just pure exultant, rampant individualism.	3

If we want to live in a Liberal society that is also tolerant, we must have a set of principles that we all digest and understand, that ground and explain, and justify why we behave as we do	in the context of what we're talking about tonight the strange phenomenon then occurred, where the British went in denial and have been in denial ever since.	3
That’s AB's sort of neutrality	That's not good enough	3
We have to go to the roots of this problem	Helen would go and work in families’ homes, working alongside them to achieve change, and that change would be around improving the circumstances for their children, and making them safe	3

NL thinks / does not think we have got a lot to apologize for	That’s very different from saying that there is a kind of systemic rot in banking	3
it is imbued with geography, history and culture	you don’t get round everything about what you should about welfare dependency and welfarism by just saying “Well I’m sorry, but I can’t deliver the revolution tomorrow.”	3
by and large a large chunk of the codes of ethics – as they’re supposedly called – actually protects shareholders and doesn’t protect customers.	I believe this is capable of reform if we introduce codes, if we stigmatise bad behaviour, if we set about within organisations making sure the codes are adhered to.	3
the welfare state should be about what people need/what they deserve	It doesn’t expect that if you have a false set of structures, or a false set of purposes, that everything will be fine if you just have very good individuals	3
very often what high levels of debt can mean, and especially when the debt is on very unjust terms, is a massive redistribution of wealth in society, from the poorest to the richest.	even if this hearing itself or the damages claims by these three individuals are concerned, it should / should not be the occasion for examining the colonial legacy	3

If there is an element of retrospective moral judgments, there are no problem with that	It is a moral problem.	3
The pragmatic justification is that they - if they are to take their case against anybody, we, this state, the British state now, is the closest they can get to it.	we’re rather over inclined - and this is also a moral issue – to focus on the anti social behaviour of the poor, rather than the antisocial behaviour of the rich: the money laundering, the rate fixing, the tax evasion	3
We’re talking about dysfunctional families	I think that we’re on a loser if we think that we’re going to get out of this by any kind of decline in individualism	3
very often they do have responsibility for what they borrow	the point about a welfare state is it was set up as a safety net, during a time of near full employment	3

when ND comes up with this line about sub-prime debt, that this was economic policy, to push loans onto people who couldn’t afford them, the people actually accepting those loans have / have no personal responsibility of their own	bosses don’t really know what’s going on	3
the Government seems to be targeting only the poor for intervention	it was an unjust war that was being levelled against the Africans	3

It very much depends on the specific incident you are talking about and which side are you going to go on?	some people have an innate desire, so called, to work harder than others	3
I gather Dutch bankers don’t just have rules and regulations	There are many different aspects to this,	3
we have to bribe people	we have to starve people	3

it is a reasonable thing for the state to intervene in those cases	there's no statute of limitations for murder	3

the government, in 2001, announced a review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974	they did what they had to do in order to maintain a liberation struggle	3
the idea behind it was that it would be for periods of sporadic unemployment	CL's no more sympathetic to economic determinism, or the idea that poverty creates this than anything else.	3

we have a huge problem with unemployment.	the history of the financial services industry demonstrates that this is an industry with a deep commitment to exploiting those weaknesses, in order to make a fast buck	3
that’s not their fault	There is no natural condition of unemployment	3
if you would like to consider the concept of non domination, freedom as non domination – the non interference on arbitrary grounds in people’s important decisions – then we have to be careful that when we do intervene it’s to increase total non domination. Which would mean not interfering simply because people are mad, sad and bad, but because they are imposing domination on their neighbours	youth unemployment is a blight on our nation	3
there is an internal failure in some cases	acknowledgment and reparation for that is the minimum moral requisite position that is required from the United Kingdom	3
There is no evidence that that’s going to work	it should be about a bit of both	3
the way they suffered was a crime	we’ll not further entrench the type of poverty	3
Claire wants more housing	we do need to get back to this idea of desert	3
there is such a lot of evidence that it does have a distorting effect	it’s obvious	3
This was a war of liberation	It’s what Ruth would think if Ruth lived next door	3
xxx is how in a different system the poor would not get the blame and is how they would not come off worse	Debt is used time and again as a set of economic decisions, and political decisions, to achieve certain things in society	3
what she was really talking about is forcing people to adapt to their conditions of poverty, rather than challenging those conditions or creating conditions where moral behaviour could better flourish.	the benefit system is precisely one of those systems that encourages immoral behaviour	3
there are 5 million people on the waiting list for social housing	as things exist at the moment, it isn’t a matter of me deciding that I want a million different things, and I'm going to really have to go out and seek a loan	3
the idea that people should take any job at any wages, any conditions is an immoral position to take	you can’t separate morals from practice	3
a situation in which Helen would tell a woman that she shouldn’t have a child, or another child would be xxx	We’re not talking of single figures	3
they have to look at the interests of the child, and to have a debate about the environment in which you bring children into the world	what this needs is not simply us putting moral blame on one side or the other, but actually putting moral blame on a set of economic policies and political decisions that have led to credit liberalisation.	3
It was a ghastly aberration	what AM's surely ignoring, and what so much of their discussion this evening has ignored, is that there are deserts around our country where there is just serial misery and hopelessness, and despair, and dysfunctionality	3
Claire's trying to just avoid saying that saving is moral	every single man, woman and child in this country is now £240,000 in debt	3
it’s not responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that	the colonial context is absent	3
that help should be very carefully calibrated, to restore the capacity for independence and personal responsibility	the wider context is the colonial dispossession	3
Nothing good happened under Nazism	if you would like to consider the concept of non domination, freedom as non domination – the non interference on arbitrary grounds in people’s important decisions – then we have to be careful that when we do intervene it’s to increase total non domination. Which would mean not interfering simply because people are mad, sad and bad, but because they are imposing domination on their neighbours	3
When you think about it now, CF finds it frustrating when she's trying to talk to people about the real state the economy is in	People move, in a life course, move in and out of work	3
JB didn’t say “Work shy”	in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	3
And the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items.	Helen would go and work in families’ homes, working alongside them to achieve change, and that change would be around improving the circumstances for their children, and making them safe	3
There are three people who it seems very likely suffered	It is not a family where children are on the threshold of being taken away	3
evidence shows that those who are in poverty are more likely to be facing all of these other forms of disadvantage	the only thing we hold in common is something abstract, which is money	3
people do not think that	one thing KM may not be aware of is just how much benefits have been cut already by inflation	3
it’s these broader circumstances that we really need to get to the nub of	That would be a baseline, that children are actually safe	3
that is not going to make young black Britons feel better	We’d still be much better off	3
That's a caricature	It depends on how one unpacks all of those terms.	3
what JL's doing is providing small loans, for short periods of time, to help them smooth out their family income	it means that we are forced to engage in this conversation	3
it’s been pointed out that borrowing money can have disadvantages, as well as advantages	this is not purely an economic issue	3
they might find it coercive.	We’re offering things on a rewards based process, which is if the local government succeeds in achieving its results then it gets more money. If it doesn’t, it won’t.	3
there are other families, where actually they do need a great deal of help	there seemed to be a germ of compassion about what Neil was saying	3
The State can never really be neutral though,	evidence shows that those who are in poverty are more likely to be facing all of these other forms of disadvantage	3
relative to many other countries surely it's an exemplar of inclusivity	instead of wasting it lining the pockets of landlords it could be used to build housing which would stimulate the economy, create jobs, bring down the welfare bill, and bring down the social housing waiting lis	3
my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	we should not just assume that people aren’t going to be suckers for such advertising	3
In a sense he’s very similar to the abolition of the Board and Lodgings Allowance that Margaret Thatcher brought in at the end of the ‘80s, which obviously saw a huge spike in rough sleeping	they really reduce unemployment	3
they actually want help,	there’s two ways we can look at this	3
people can be tempted out of work	my income is likely to drop	3
they are right about that	society benefits / suffers	3
They do	consumers should have all the information that they need	3
it’s the former	Anne and Ruth agree that there are some troubled families	3
There are many families, and Louise Casey has this in mind, where for a variety of reasons a lone mother – and it’s usually a lone mother – cannot look after her children properly, doesn’t know how to very often	that takes ES xxx	3
in the end it’s culture not faith that might save us	CF is interested in the demoralising impact of welfarism 	3
people should not have to pay their debts	If you didn’t have investment banking, you’d have to recreate it.	3
I think the relics of colonialism, racism and the current dystopia around in relation to people groping focus a kind of inclusive British citizenship that relieves them of the guilt of their - of the past, and opens up a vista of an inclusive future, actually relies on, to some extent, Britain having a truth and reconciliation moment,	if Britain thinks that it can move on to an inclusive citizenship without addressing these historical relics of colonialism that continue to plague contemporary debates about citizenship then frankly it's fooling itself	3
sometimes taking out credit can also help you not be dependent.	Melanie's talking about the de-incentivisation of marriage, on the basis that we can’t possibly talk about marriage as opposed to un-marriage	3
the discourse around this that we’ve had, with some of these very hysterical comments from Louise Casey and the Government, are not acceptable	clearly there may have to be some structural change	3
that’s not right	someone will always find a way around a rule.	3
it is ‘scroungers	That is not the world we live in	3
the reason banks take excessive risk is that they don’t pay the price for that risk-taking, because of the government guarantee	the reality is that in the last ten or twenty years there’s been a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, and from the young to the old, and that what Neil's really trying to do is to justify that by blaming the poor for their position	3
the only thing we hold in common is something abstract, which is money	it’s so insulting	3
they were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of young people, desperate for work	many of the families they have to teach them how to have fun, and enjoy their children	3
it is the knock down argument	Christianity has a problem with wealth creation	3
the only thing we hold in common is something abstract, which is money	If we don’t give more benefits, more welfare, we’re going to end up with homeless young people everywhere, destitution and so on	3
the situation in Kenya was a bloody dirty war	It’s more than just impact.	3
someone will always find a way around a rule.	there are two different ways of improving the incentives to work	3
That is not the world we live in	there’s nothing necessarily positive about saving	3
In most other countries there’s something like an unemployment insurance	there were crimes against humanity	3
KM's not in this business	I think you are simplifying your duality.	3
It is about a kind of moral responsibility that the State also has, both to the next generation; to children who grew up in a situation which may set them off on a completely wrong track in life, in which people themselves are often rather miserable and trapped?	that really is outrageous	3
It doesn’t go to the tenant	what’s happening in the industrial revolution we’re experiencing at the moment, is precisely that 70% of the world is benefitting from it. Whereas the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century was confined to Europe and North America.	3
many people are working who get it	it’s not going to have the effect that Cameron believes that it will	3
what she was really talking about is forcing people to adapt to their conditions of poverty, rather than challenging those conditions or creating conditions where moral behaviour could better flourish.	It is a safety net	3
that it is a problem	there are many poor people who don’t live like this	3
nothing horrible was done under the Empire	They can't go back and dig up Macmillan	3
That is the real lived experience of ordinary working class people	The difference is that this was an aberration	3
JB would want to abolish the welfare state altogether	they're not absolutely right	3
what JL's doing is providing small loans, for short periods of time, to help them smooth out their family income	the Jewish community was shipped to Auschwitz	3
it’s so insulting	they are pushing	3
The pragmatic justification is that they - if they are to take their case against anybody, we, this state, the British state now, is the closest they can get to it.	clearly there may have to be some structural change	3
problem families are problem families because they cause problems/ they face problems	last year 93% of new claimants were in a household in which somebody worked	3
they shouldn’t be angry with young people who are making use of the welfare state	The poor don’t lack that any more than the rich.	3
part of the problem is the distinction people have drawn between the State and society.	a number of these families exist who do cause problems to the children who grow up in them, and the people around them.	3
Merthyr Tydfil, in Wales has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country	Melanie doesn’t want to get bogged down into a discussion about a figure	3
sometimes taking out credit can also help you not be dependent.	It’s not necessarily a moral good	3
they really reduce unemployment	it’s going back to the politics of the poor house	3
the present government of Britain should be held responsible for responsibility for the these atrocities of its predecessor administration many decades ago	the desire to work is innate	3
They want voters who feel artificially rich	That’s a very sort of, cost/benefit analysis approach to social policy and family life	3
they are right about that	that’s a big moral problem	3
one of the big initiatives that Romin's looking at, is the troubled families initiative; this idea that this hardcore of really difficult families that we need to look at	there are not very specific perpetrators	3
it doesn’t actually answer the problem;	JL's industry doesn’t want to pull the wool over people’s eyes.	3
if you haven’t had that template then you can’t	these are largely poor areas	3
they have to look at the interests of the child, and to have a debate about the environment in which you bring children into the world	even if this hearing itself or the damages claims by these three individuals are concerned, it should / should not be the occasion for examining the colonial legacy	3
While we were enjoying the benefits of the boom, in the first decade of this century, manufacturing output was declining by 25%	we are getting to the point where debt is simply going out of control	3
they did what they had to do in order to maintain a liberation struggle	let’s not just call them ‘scroungers’	3
it speaks well for the case that is being brought at the moment	this is not purely an economic issue	3
only since the welfare state has there been permanent unemployment	people like KM who believe as a utopia, are precisely the ones who have led to bad policies and bad results.	3
it’s been pointed out that borrowing money can have disadvantages, as well as advantages	SR should not be so worried about restoring stigma	3
It is the case that some of the greatest examples of social progress over the years have come from well-off rich people, banks and so on, investing productively	these aspects have been looked at in huge detail in the last 10 years by government, by consumer groups, by the industry, by academics	3
They do	that has become incredibly dangerous and insupportable	3
The are other instances that bring up questions about imperial rule	bankers went to great lengths to advertise how prudent they were	3
there’s a huge amount of evidence, research, academic anecdotal that says certain factors make it much more likely that you will not exit poverty, or you won’t prevent poverty. Poverty being more than income, by the way	They did see this as being like under the Third Reich in effect.	3
it would not be okay under these circumstances for, say, a holocaust victim to take a civil damages case against Angela Merkel	there’s two ways we can look at this	3
we shouldn’t be too optimistic there that we can develop regulation that makes banks change their cultures	in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	3
people can be tempted out of work	what is the good life? is the question	3
there are not very specific perpetrators	CF was trying to cross-examine the first witness, but she actually seemed to be quite concerned about some of the things coming out of the Government	3
one of the problems we’re facing now is the fact that organisations, and indeed people who require debt, that what we’re doing is rolling everything over	By the 50s, the Empire is going	3
the problem of family breakdown started with middle class people, like Professor’s of Sociology quite frankly.	There are two different views about State intervention.	3
that’s coming down as a cohort effect	Human beings are not very good at the long-term	3
when rents are soaring, they can’t afford to pay their rent.	here you don't have specific perpetrators.	3
there are many forms of state intervention	that might be breakdown of family, and instability, a welfare system that doesn’t promote work, an education system that doesn’t give you a chance to get a job, debt, alcohol and drugs…	3
there is no statute of limitations	key thing in British society is the horror at the violence of the Mau Mau which is profoundly shocking	3
They manage risk	the debts that are owed now, by us as a country, even if not individually, are a result of the fact that the banks have got off Scot free	3
child tax credit is just like a much more generous version of child benefit	people like KM who believe as a utopia, are precisely the ones who have led to bad policies and bad results.	3
If that’s the kind of job system that Neil wants, it seems to be a deeply immoral way of dealing with the quest of work, and how people should look at work	you often have public inquiries and open investigations	3
what has driven a great deal of the problems that we’ve got now is the need for capital to find new ways of making money	They get nothing out of it	3
morally,Ruth has / has not any objection to this intervention	there is an internal failure in some cases	3
it seems to me we have to somehow find – to educate people in the sense that they have to cope with this complexity	eighteen plus're kind of overgrown children	3
The interest rate varies by the amount of the charge for the credit but also the time over which you repay it	it’s particularly morally repugnant for the State to tell us who should and shouldn’t have children	3
there is one caveat	it's not brutal enough	3
That's what drove it	And the problem is, as we have things at the moment, with inflation so high and interest rates at rock bottom, savers are seeing their money taken away from them	3
it is more dishonest than other walks of life, because of what it is and what it does	bankruptcy is xxx	3
there are cases where families are harming themselves and harming others	there are families that are in trouble	3
William Beveridge thought about having this two-tier system	they take us to questions we have still got to resolve.	3
there’s no chance	we should not just assume that people aren’t going to be suckers for such advertising	3
JB doesn't know whether it is innate or not	I think Michael Portillo is completely wrong	3
They should actually be taking more risk and giving more money out	their core bills don’t	3
much debt is incredibly valuable.	Investment banks have to become environments where the risk, all the risk, falls on the people within the institutions.	3
we have xxx much legal responsibility for the actions of the past	a legal remedy exists	3
it’s a way of transforming the moral issue from a lack of jobs, a lack of a provision, to an internal failure to do that	young people should go out and get something from the world, contribute something to the world. Instead of saying “Why can’t I get a well paid job? Why can’t I get a house?”	3
the old idea of welfarism as a safety net, has changed	JB  wouldn’t use the word ‘moral’	3
the desire to work is innate	the push is coming from the people with the money	3
It should try to be as neutral as possible between those, except in cases such that people’s chosen morality prevents other people from living their lives.	In Hammersmith, Fulham, Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster, which is a tri-borough consortium, they were given the target of 1720 families out of the 120,000	3
if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on	you get certain ‘social goods’ which are greater than that	3
that’s dangerous	incentives are irrelevant	3
it’s not going to have the effect that Cameron believes that it will	only since the welfare state has there been permanent unemployment	3
one of the jobs that the welfare system is quite reputably there to do, is to try and encourage the best of people, and to encourage the best that they can do	we do have a culture of profligacy and fecklessness	3
JB's never referred to them being work shy	we don't have the perpetrators in court	3
Lawrence James doesn't really like this case	what we had was a whiff of class war, and a lot of moral displacement	3
The government comes and bails me out	Over a million people, young people, without work, it has a scarring impact	3
It’s a bit like saying wearing a jumper is moral	There is no universal definition in relation to its application  	3
we’ve got a set of good practice parents, good practice child rearing,	One is to change the balance of or the generosity of out of work beneifts, maybe spend more on in work benefits like tax credits and so on	3
The aim of the Government is very clear; looking at family households that are multiply disadvantaged	there are high levels of concern over their ability to care for their children	3
It's only for Esther colonialism that is on trial here, not the behaviour of the insurgents at the time	they can’t get full time work	3
the system seems to be very, very heavily weighted against them.	otherwise I don’t receive self-respect	3
I want Barclays to be less able – I think they should be smaller, I want to break it up, I want to break up the investment banking from retail banking; very, very specific.	as a society we had created a set of social norms and values which protected us from our innate short-termism	3
interest rates are being kept really low, in order that borrowers won’t bear the consequences of their foolish borrowing.	people like KM who believe as a utopia, are precisely the ones who have led to bad policies and bad results.	3
this cost is forced onto them	in itself there is / is not a danger there	3
That’s a rather specific example	there is too much debt because xxx	3
There are two different views about State intervention.	that is not irresponsible	3
The interest rate varies by the amount of the charge for the credit but also the time over which you repay it	we lack any sense of the common good	3
We are here on Mandela's birthday and his leadership in relation to South Africa was one in which he sought to explore these issues, reconcile them, bring them to account, to apologise, to effect reparation where necessary, to acknowledge the crime	You would think that you were imposing a kind of domination on your neighbors if you were just behaving very badly, and making everybody’s lives a misery around you	3
we haven’t actually done as much as we could have done	it’s a good idea, in a free society, to free people if they do get into terrible debt	3
there are two other brackets that I would bring within the troubled family scenario	it’s not responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that	3
these are banking reforms, they’re not moral	they’ve overcome them	3
that is really quite  in al this	they're not absolutely right	3
In a sentence, JA thinks / does not think this particular court case might provide this Mdeba moment	it was in fact typical	3
they are the home of continuing morality in some ways	there were crimes against humanity	3
It was a ghastly aberration	You are just scapegoating an entire bunch of people, the vast majority of whom one has no reason to believe do anything other than behave with honesty and integrity.	3
the State is already helping them	it’s because of government interference	3
The Empire brought a lot of good things	that’s sometimes related not being in work	3
there is an internal failure in some cases	there is something in it	3
the way people respond, people’s agency, is inevitably in the context of the lives in which they live	we are getting to the point where debt is simply going out of control	3
what we need to look at is we need to look at other ways of incentivising; making work pay. Looking at the barriers that exist for young people to get into work	Justice would be multi-facetted	3
If you didn’t have investment banking, you’d have to recreate it.	it was an unjust war that was being levelled against the Africans	3
Kenya was a brutal war,	that's MT's opinion	3
interest rates are being kept really low, in order that borrowers won’t bear the consequences of their foolish borrowing.	CF went to a lot of conferences, with a lot of policy people, who said, “We are living in a new era, the knowledge economy. We don’t have to produce anything anymore. Guess what? I mean, we can...”	3
they are vulnerable	that’s what social services have a responsibility to deal with	3
only since the welfare state has there been permanent unemployment	the welfare system is the problem	3
savers have lost out	I do not believe in free, free, free market Capitalism, as if there’s absolutely no regulation whatsoever.	3
what JL's doing is providing small loans, for short periods of time, to help them smooth out their family income	there’s a demand of equal concern that the State has for everyone, such that if these interventions are not working for the most needy cases	3
the situation in Kenya was a bloody dirty war	that’s sometimes related not being in work	3
they are somehow or another demoralized and broken	I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	3
families have low income	she has been so poorly parented	3
they find it hard to put the two at odds, and to understand that they ought to be leaning towards the common good and not towards personal and individual interest	moral justice lies xxx when we look back at our imperial past	3
they are effectively trying to hand over to some kind of stable rule	No parent in the family is in work	3
because of his fetish about non- domination there was very little in which he would ever intervene	the conditions under which people live aren’t conducive to moral flourishing, and therefore what you want to do is challenge those conditions, change them	3
that is a not a bad thing	the reason that so many people have defaulted on their mortgages is a result of tens of thousands of random decisions by individuals?	3
JB doesn't know whether it is innate or not	they had to be over-hauled because xxx	3
JB didn’t refer to utopia	It can’t be shamed into good behaviour, or even punished into good behaviour.	3
They face the same risk	It can be a way of demonstrating independence	3
they cannot cope with the consequences of this progressive and incremental social family breakdown. 	In terms of moral responsibility then it, is pretty much anything allowed to them because it was a struggle of liberation	3
a country can even say, “We’re going to go bankrupt. It’s humiliating. We’ll do it. We’ll start again. We’ll grow	JL is actually financing consumer spending, as opposed to investment	3
individuals are not  feckless and lazy	That’s how JB regards it	3
abolishing housing benefit for under 25s will lead to homelessness, hidden homelessness, sofa surfing, staying with the wrong people	one of the groups of people who were kind of interested in thrift and prudence were early productive capitalists, who established the capitalist system	3
it’s not particularly attractive	all that you need is a kind of credit based consumer thing	3
There’s no free education	NL thinks / does not think we have got a lot to apologize for	3
I think in order to change investment banks you have to actually focus on not just specific rules, which in the introduction was described as ‘box ticking’,	If they’re going to be of working age, able bodied, and if they’re going to get benefits; they should not be allowed just to sit at home on benefits	3
a high proportion of people are desperate to work, that work on such low wages that they have to have benefits in order to top them up	the State is already helping them	3
that’s fair enough	that’s the distinction	3
it does need reform	This guy’s just a scrounger, he needs a kick up the backside to get going	3
I don’t think rules are totally primary	what we have is an artificial suppression of the price of money	3
I welcomed them to the Church actually	Investment banks have to become environments where the risk, all the risk, falls on the people within the institutions.	3
It was a ghastly aberration	that’s actually coming down as a cohort effect anyway	3
The State can provide information, guidance, and assistance on a voluntary basis.	they’ll show you how to do it	3
Kenya was a brutal war,	they make more money out of it	3
you have the sense that it’s okay to make a reasonable profit, but I’ve got to have a social purpose as well	I think the relics of colonialism, racism and the current dystopia around in relation to people groping focus a kind of inclusive British citizenship that relieves them of the guilt of their - of the past, and opens up a vista of an inclusive future, actually relies on, to some extent, Britain having a truth and reconciliation moment,	3
It does work up to a point insofar that the introduction of tax credits did move some groups, particularly lone parents, that helped to get more of them into employment	JB doesn't start from that position	3
It can’t just sit there	There are benefits to work, obviously self-esteem, aspiration, sort of intangible goods which individuals feel	3
they have lost their ability to do that	in the developed world that wasn’t making enough money	3
I think it’s more a matter of trying to shape	the history of America shows that.	3
Prudent/imprudent, it makes no difference to people lending their money to banks	We’re talking about dysfunctional families	3
we have to look at it in that way	It’s created a lot of victims who now need help themselves, and who sometimes go on to create other victims through crime	3
the figures are a moral issue	that does seem to correspond to the reality	3
Ruth doesn't like the definition of troubled families, or anything much about all of this	they will have experienced a drop of 10% overall in their living standards	3
Owen's problem is that Owen will not say whether Owen finds it inherently undesirable or not, or that it leads to a situation which is very bad because it traps people	This stopped not because of the big bang, which liberalised banking, which is what everybody thinks	3
AM felt more strongly against that even than Melanie,	there is/ is not a moral distinction between the two	3
there should be both savers and borrowers, naturally	JB's never referred to them being work shy	3
the problem we always have with debt, which SR would use rather than credit, is that ultimately there is interest.	Yes, and even with these egregious examples of which I am the strongest possible critic, it is the case – because the system is still just about working – that trust and credit, and codes and mutuality and things like that still exist, to some extent.	3
buy now, pay later, is the kind of core morality of consumer capitalism	there should be a window of apology and getting back to common sense.	3
we need to think about, how we have a more paternalist system for people like that	People move, in a life course, move in and out of work	3
There’s a risk that they can be brought up into wonderful families and turn into monsters.	there’s some political rhetoric flying around that CG would not choose to be using.	3
it can if they can get it to the people who need it	individual faith, whatever it’s kind – religious faith or secular faith – faith is completely contingent on our social circumstances	3
That’s a rather specific example	people are not naturally work shy	3
unemployment comes about on a mass permanent scale entirely because of the welfare state	the big underlying moral problem with a debt-based free market economy is that when it goes bad, as it does tend to do, it’s always the poor that gets the blame	3
there are lots of ways in which we can change our welfare state to make it better	my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	3
the problem is that’s been the policy for the last three decades, to encourage huge amounts of borrowing to keep the economy going	MT has got to look at the underlying economic incentives	3
they enjoy that	that was a label that was given to them	3
the wrong investments are made	in terms of the morality of this, we have to be careful of stigmatising debt and remember the creative aspect of credit	3
I think one interesting thing to look at is difference between the adverts that investment banks for clients in things like The Economist or The Financial Times, which say that they’re all about innovation and client service, and then the values that they espouse internally. Particularly during annual reviews, where what they’re after is people who are about making money, and are committed to making money for the firm.	there were atrocities on both sides, including in this big group of people that Esther has just referred to	3
James was blaming the system	this is the moral maze	3
they are proceeding with it	CF was trying to cross-examine the first witness, but she actually seemed to be quite concerned about some of the things coming out of the Government	3
People are no more stupid now than they were 150 years ago	Owen has answered Anne's question	3
Barclay's is an institution that can't carry on.	it’s not necessarily solely a moral question	3
some people are not working because they can make a penny more from giving up their job and living at home	this idea that because there were bad apples in the past nothing has changed for the worse, is the argument that’s used about crime; it’s a real cop out	3
that’s what they get	Helen would take, and Family Action, a much broader view about who troubled families actually are	3
MT overestimates the role of ideas in these matters	CG is not taking the first notion of what morality is	3
the violence that the Mau Mau perpetrated against settlers and particularly loyal Africans xxx	even if this hearing itself or the damages claims by these three individuals are concerned, it should / should not be the occasion for examining the colonial legacy	3
the first and third witnesses didn't seem to draw much a distinction between the British Empire and the Third Reich.	you get certain ‘social goods’ which are greater than that	3
it was something like 16% of sub-prime borrowers didn’t even make a first payment	AM shouldn't go all ‘Fifty Shades of Grey'	3
There’s no value for a banker in being prudent anymore	Ruth quarrelled with the statistics	3
That means not simply looking at the individual, but to change the conditions and provide those sorts of conditions.	that’s what William Beveridge wanted when he was designing the welfare state	3
there were crimes against humanity	poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause	3
I wasn’t suggesting that it was guilt money	If I lend you money, I'm taking a risk	3
One is to change the balance of or the generosity of out of work beneifts, maybe spend more on in work benefits like tax credits and so on	in the context of what we're talking about tonight the strange phenomenon then occurred, where the British went in denial and have been in denial ever since.	3
welfarism has become an all consuming be all and end all for a significant minority of society	credit raises living standards	3
we must get back to who these families are and why they are so  dysfunctional	it needs thoughtful reform to avoid the tendency that it has to trap people in dependency as a way of life	3
The judiciary have ruled they have the right to make this case	What seems therefore ridiculous is that in order to solve the problem of over dependency on the State in certain families. What they do is, is they parachute in as the State, and usurps people’s moral autonomy	3
they’re not going to do it on their own	It is not a family where children are on the threshold of being taken away	3
as we all know, the moral case is absolutely unanswerable	there are two other brackets that I would bring within the troubled family scenario	3
That would be the normality	Claire's a campaigner for more housing	3
that’s a little odd	they are right about that	3
Yes, and even with these egregious examples of which I am the strongest possible critic, it is the case – because the system is still just about working – that trust and credit, and codes and mutuality and things like that still exist, to some extent.	You have a specific perpetrator	3
the discourse around this that we’ve had, with some of these very hysterical comments from Louise Casey and the Government, are not acceptable	If Ruth's not wholly opposed to it, she finds xxx so objectionable that Louise Casey’s offering	3
in the end it’s culture not faith that might save us	you don’t need to be working to claim it	3
we don't have the perpetrators in court	that’s slightly disingenuous	3
JB: did not take adversarial position towards the poor unfortunate people who’ve been trapped in the trap	it’s not going to have the effect that Cameron believes that it will	3
the history of the financial services industry demonstrates that this is an industry with a deep commitment to exploiting those weaknesses, in order to make a fast buck	You’re kidding CF	3
it means that we are forced to engage in this conversation	these things are in some sort of a balance	3
there’s quite a substantial element of blame of the people who are so called ‘undeserving’, even if Neil doesn't accept the term	these were not terrorists	3
We mustn't equate poverty with dysfunction	that’s a little odd	3
that is a case of some paternalism	That would be the normality	3
If you look at these things, as anyone in work would look at, if you can’t afford to have children the State should not step in and say “Unconditionally, we will support you if you make the decision to have children you can’t afford”	it’s these other areas, these increasing interventions that Claire is interested in	3
the history of America shows that.	JB didn't say that	3
Ruth has an objection to an intervention on the basis of people being poor, as opposed to an intervention on the basis of children genuinely being at risk of neglect or harm	Kenyan cannot just do little policy bits to get Kenan off the argument	3
it’s, as it were, intellectually honest to kind of play out the virtues of saving, as opposed to borrowing, when really, unless the two kind of balance out in an economy, there’s no point saving	They did see this as being like under the Third Reich in effect.	3
AM doesn't quite understand what RS's real criticism is of what Mr Cameron was saying	They did see this as being like under the Third Reich in effect.	3
There’s an upfront, and later.	xxx is how in a different system the poor would not get the blame and is how they would not come off worse	3
They can't go back and dig up Macmillan	individual faith is not strong enough	3
it’s derived again from the tendency towards bail-outs.	her mother was so poorly parented	3
you can’t separate morals from practice	They get nothing out of it	3
Christian tries  to reform individuals	it's a symbolic case, to open a wider door	3
you don’t get round everything about what you should about welfare dependency and welfarism by just saying “Well I’m sorry, but I can’t deliver the revolution tomorrow.”	Anne's completely misunderstood the point of housing benefit	3
It’s not beyond the imagination to imagine the young might get up and go and do something about this, other than kind of sit and wait to be handed something.	The State can never really be neutral though,	3
Really horrible things might have happened to them	AB does not want to suggest that there’s no role for the State.	3
it is also very much a trap	if I want a washing machine, I have to go to the launderette every week at the moment and spend several pounds in the launderette	3
you often have public inquiries and open investigations	we’re not going to get rid of the welfare state	3
They’ve basically not been fated by that	Think about Bill Gates and all the wonderful things that his money is doing.	3
state intervention only seems to be coercive state intervention in the lives and families of the poor	that would not be the British Government's view	3
I do not believe in free, free, free market Capitalism, as if there’s absolutely no regulation whatsoever.	we already have legislation that can deal with keeping children safe and ensuring they get to school on time	3
we’re not so much aware that trust is lacking	that’s a distinction that we’ve somehow lost	3
she was helping them manage their resources.	it’s quite striking that all three witnesses, coming from very different positions, put their finger on that	3
that’s not their fault	people are incentivised to remain unemployed	3
if you create a structure that says “Make decisions about family structures in a way that you feel benefits you”, but the state gives you a neutral level playing field, that’s a great thing	we need to think about how to describe the problem, and understand the problem accurately	3
I would give, as one example of an organisation that’s changed, the BBC actually, which now tends to be pretty truthful even if only because it wasn’t in the past.	which is the supreme example of just that individualism and abstraction	3
I think that we’re on a loser if we think that we’re going to get out of this by any kind of decline in individualism	my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	3
the government guarantees your welfare in old age	politicians are not taking a moral stance over welfare reform	3
Helen would like social workers to teach people to pay their rent on time, get children to school on time; those kinds of things	they are proceeding with it	3
Debt is used time and again as a set of economic decisions, and political decisions, to achieve certain things in society	These are families with a very wide range of needs	3
it will be an important opportunity for the individuals to make their case	they are on the edges or actually committing crime	3
people do not think that	it is ‘scroungers	3
that is a not a bad thing	Cameron has / has not a point	3
the answer is that there’s too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep	That’s the difference	3
a high proportion of people are desperate to work, that work on such low wages that they have to have benefits in order to top them up	And the problem is, as we have things at the moment, with inflation so high and interest rates at rock bottom, savers are seeing their money taken away from them	3
it was a struggle of liberation	In the old days of early capitalism, bankers were famously prudent people	3
That’s AB's sort of neutrality	they reflect the standards of business generally	3
the government guarantees your welfare in old age	that is / is not part of JA's case	3
they are effectively trying to hand over to some kind of stable rule	it is not the equivalent of calling people feckless and lazy to say that a lot of young people have become so dependent that they say `Why should I take that job? I don't want to get up that early.''	3
if ND's going to raise his banner for anybody who’s doing badly in this situation, he should have raised it for savers, in the first instance	that’s not necessarily how the welfare state was ever intended to work, or the way it does work	3
they want the relationships that go with work	We had a boom that was fuelled by government spending and by debt, too much of which did not go to productive uses	3
JB's no idea whether it’s innate	very often what high levels of debt can mean, and especially when the debt is on very unjust terms, is a massive redistribution of wealth in society, from the poorest to the richest.	3
families have low income	MP has some savings, and MP has some borrowings as well .	3
there are 5 million people on the waiting list for social housing	Some regulation might help	3
he was rather flattering about the virtue of putting off making buying decisions until you can actually afford it, which is a very old-fashioned virtue	the areas of their life you intervene on, in order to bring about change are xxx	3
you are on the side of the nationalist movements which replaced the British Empire	the banks are the lenders	3
Neil's not trying to justify anything	MP wouldn't go as far as Lawrence James went	3
That’s not good	debt is morally neutral	3
if you’ve got money you can get more money	That means not simply looking at the individual, but to change the conditions and provide those sorts of conditions.	3
AM wasn't remotely convinced by Lee Jasper's argument that this would help black Britons today	it could not possibly follow from this very deleterious account of colonialism that JA has just given	3
people have run up lots of debt, are paying very low rates of interest, and they’re able to continue to live in houses that they can’t afford to pay for.	in terms of the case of these individuals they have a perfect right to pursue the claim that they are making and it is reasonable for the British state, even though today's politicians weren't implicated in this, for the British state to be answerable of the actions of the British state in the past, in this specific case	3
corporations have no souls to damn and no bodies to kick.	they’re not just playing with their own money	3
the sense of individual self-reliance, and standing on your own two feet and doing everything to avoid taking money from the state has not been chipped away at by the growth of welfarism	The poor don’t lack that any more than the rich.	3
that's MT's opinion	they’ll be the first, often, to admit they need a lot of help.	3
it’s moved the furthest away of any of the industrialised countries from a contributory system where what you’ve paid in is what you get out	The Armed Forces is a very good example	3
they’re going to try and serve its purposes	JA has heard lots of judgments of people being found guilty of uttering racially offensive remarks without themselves being what JA would call a card carrying racist	3
this is not purely an economic issue	it seems to me that’s it’s almost as if you had a water utility, a hybrid company of a water utility, and a casino and then when the casino goes bust they say “Well I’m terribly sorry, we’re a water utility really, so we can’t go bust.”	3
Ruth has an objection to an intervention on the basis of people being poor, as opposed to an intervention on the basis of children genuinely being at risk of neglect or harm	Human beings are not very good at the long-term	3
CF's got no savings	You would think that you were imposing a kind of domination on your neighbors if you were just behaving very badly, and making everybody’s lives a misery around you	3
Christian tries  to reform individuals	these people are alive	3
No parent in the family is in work;	I think in order to change investment banks you have to actually focus on not just specific rules, which in the introduction was described as ‘box ticking’,	3
If you have exemplars	AB does not want to suggest that there’s no role for the State.	3
people on minimum wage usually have benefits; are usually forced to take on benefits	JA makes that parallel	3
their particular problems were entirely resultant of the circumstances in which they found themselves	one that ought to, at least to some extent, be resurrected	3
one that ought to, at least to some extent, be resurrected	housing benefit, particularly when paid out very young to so many young people, has a debilitating-	3
that is fair	they make more money out of it	3
Yes, and even with these egregious examples of which I am the strongest possible critic, it is the case – because the system is still just about working – that trust and credit, and codes and mutuality and things like that still exist, to some extent.	there were crimes against humanity	3
that in turn reinforces the centrality of money, and particularly of finance capital	That surely, more than anything else, has driven the phenomenon in which thousands and thousands of children are being brought up in elective fatherless families, and are going potty as a result.	3
if it's an emotional thing to do with blame and guilt, CL personally feels dishonoured by what was done in his name	The way Neil would describe a lot of the people Neil's met who have been long term unemployed is kind of defeated, kind of depressed	3
Kenya was a brutal war,	While we were enjoying the benefits of the boom, in the first decade of this century, manufacturing output was declining by 25%	3
it would not be okay under these circumstances for, say, a holocaust victim to take a civil damages case against Angela Merkel	if you were a Martian, and you descended and looked at what’s going on at the moment, the first thing you would say is that the lenders are being under-rewarded, not that the borrowers are being fleeced.	3
if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on	There’s an upfront, and later.	3
you do have to have certain rudiments of knowledge about yourself, about structures, and how you live with other people.	the problem is they are often in low paid work	3
there are survivors, who have never experienced any form of recompense	Investment banks have to become environments where the risk, all the risk, falls on the people within the institutions.	3
It’s so unnatural	we have a huge problem with unemployment.	3
that’s a little odd	They don’t explain what ethical behaviour is,	3
people would require the social context in which work happens	the problems we have is when debt gets out of control.	3
Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	Anne misunderstands how housing benefit works	3
the Government is deliberately using a figure which is about multiple deprivation	this actually has a fine tradition elsewhere	3
it’s moved the furthest away of any of the industrialised countries from a contributory system where what you’ve paid in is what you get out	problem families are problem families because they cause problems/ they face problems	3
Whether it means interfering in those families being able to conduct a flourishing life; whether it’s intervening in their property, in their bodily integrity; in their mental wellbeing by continuous harassment or nuisance.	we haven’t actually done as much as we could have done	3
It’s so unnatural	people like KM who believe as a utopia, are precisely the ones who have led to bad policies and bad results.	3
Maybe in terms of managing risks to people who work in investment banks, not so much for the rest of us. 	it’s these broader circumstances that we really need to get to the nub of	3
‘welfare to work’ creates the opposite of a dependency on welfare state	I think that the government has a very strong role in that.	3
JB didn't say he wants to get rid of the welfare state, the welfare system	that’s sometimes related not being in work	3
if Ruth keeps going like that, we won’t find any at all	you don’t need it, anyway	3
people who took the sub-prime mortgages were the beneficiaries – and now the sufferers – of a policy	the sense of individual self-reliance, and standing on your own two feet and doing everything to avoid taking money from the state has not been chipped away at by the growth of welfarism	3
If you look at these things, as anyone in work would look at, if you can’t afford to have children the State should not step in and say “Unconditionally, we will support you if you make the decision to have children you can’t afford”	JA has heard lots of judgments of people being found guilty of uttering racially offensive remarks without themselves being what JA would call a card carrying racist	3
very often what high levels of debt can mean, and especially when the debt is on very unjust terms, is a massive redistribution of wealth in society, from the poorest to the richest.	this activity is, in fact, taking a very unfair advantage of people in a moment of great weakness	3
there are not very specific perpetrators	Clifford had quite an entertaining discussion with James	3
they have the opportunity now to try to seek justice	What is wrong with what she is doing is that she is presenting that tiny minority of troubled families as typical of the poor	3
that help should be very carefully calibrated, to restore the capacity for independence and personal responsibility	the problem with freedom is it’s become a cuckoo value	3
Sometimes people just want to have more children, even if they can’t afford them	the problem of family breakdown started with middle class people, like Professor’s of Sociology quite frankly.	3
if it's such an exploitative thing, there should not be outrage	troubled families / troublesome families is / is not the crux of it	3
JA has heard lots of judgments of people being found guilty of uttering racially offensive remarks without themselves being what JA would call a card carrying racist	If you’re going to work very hard for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and you’re going to make only £1 more than you would have made on benefits the urge to get a job is not as strong as it would be if you’d otherwise be penniless	3
the debts that are owed now, by us as a country, even if not individually, are a result of the fact that the banks have got off Scot free	whilst the African Americans are socially segregated from their American cousins, they are economically integrated	3
JL doesn’t buy that at all	one of the problems we’re facing now is the fact that organisations, and indeed people who require debt, that what we’re doing is rolling everything over	3
the government has acknowledged that they were ill treated in court	the system seems to be very, very heavily weighted against them.	3
And, in turn, the credit liberalisation was fuelled as a specific economic policy to paper over the cracks of inequality, as a result of other economic policies	You’re kidding CF	3
CF was trying to cross-examine the first witness, but she actually seemed to be quite concerned about some of the things coming out of the Government	the government has acknowledged that they were ill treated in court	3
he half did	xxx is where the money flowed	3
People have a moral duty to work to support themselves	The number of people that fall in the category that the 120,000 comes from, has been falling since 2004	3
There is absolute impunity for lenders at that level	we should not just assume that people aren’t going to be suckers for such advertising	3
Really horrible things might have happened to them	it is not the equivalent of calling people feckless and lazy to say that a lot of young people have become so dependent that they say `Why should I take that job? I don't want to get up that early.''	3
MT overestimates that	CF hasn’t tried it yet,	3
 that is not enough	I do not believe in free, free, free market Capitalism, as if there’s absolutely no regulation whatsoever.	3
We don’t allow fatty products to say they're healthy	that’s sometimes related not being in work,	3
to concentrate simply on the individual, and his or her response, as opposed to the context of their lives, is immoral.	We still defer to the Queen	3
the conditions under which people live aren’t conducive to moral flourishing, and therefore what you want to do is challenge those conditions, change them	investment banks have high complexity	3
that is not quite in all this	there is something in it	3
these families, and the problems they face, have many causes, complicated, springing from social structures, cultural attitudes, all sorts of things	somehow bankers want people to get into excessive debt	3
it’s derived again from the tendency towards bail-outs.	you’ve got about 30% of claimants who’ve got some sort of attitudinal problem	3
in itself this is undesirable	in the current situation both savers and borrowers are doing extremely badly	3
that also though goes back to the state of the economy	we are quite hung up about this	3
that's not a specific example	incentives and compulsions are irrelevant.	3
what we need much more is a sense of reciprocity that it’s not just that my interest happens to coincide with yours.	It’s fine to say to people, “You can decide what the good life is”, absolutely; autonomy, fine.	3
the young guy was smoking a lot of spliff	saving is morally good and can lead you to not be dependent	3
I think a lot of people would like to reject their bank, but they find it practically difficult to do so	the reason that so many people have defaulted on their mortgages is a result of tens of thousands of random decisions by individuals?	3
people are being incentivised to take huge amounts of risks, with my money.	if you get into debt, and you can never get out of it, that’s slavery	3
there were insurgents as Melanie would call them	they are not	3
Pensions mis-selling for example, hidden credit card charges	In general, society does	3
that's not correct	there are too many people included in those categories	3
people or nations have responsibility for what they borrow	there is a distorting effect on whether you’re prepared to go into training, whether you will go back in to the labour market; on what terms you’re prepared to take a job	3
these people are alive	continuing to intervene, not pausing.	3
This is not all morally blameworthy	it's not racism	3
It’s no excuse	they really reduce unemployment	3
JB's never referred to them being work shy	the idea of ‘the’ problem family is a useful invention that’s been used again and again to police the poor, and to place the blame for social problems on individuals	3
they might find it coercive.	That's not what Esther stated	3
it is / is not Lee's position that the current British Government has a lot more to apologize for in terms of colonialism than the ill-treatment of some now elderly Kenyans	It’s been done to them, not done by them	3
That’s how JB regards it	If Ruth's not wholly opposed to it, she finds xxx so objectionable that Louise Casey’s offering	3
it is a good point Clifford makes	the reason that so many people have defaulted on their mortgages is not the result of tens of thousands of random decisions by individuals	3
the way they suffered was a crime	JB likens it to a mouse trap which has a rather stale piece of cheese in it	3
you can’t blame the people who are rationally taking housing benefit when they can’t afford to pay their rent	JL's industry wants to comply with the regulations that others have determined. Not just in the UK, but in the whole of the EU	3
it is / is not right in its strategy for tackling it	it has to be understood amongst a basket of values including things like fairness	3
It is a moral problem.	We don't look at it halfway through	3
This is often a working benefit	if you add up all the debt, from all the sectors in the economy, we’re actually having 10 times our annual income	3
this is a live debate	The constant need for government to regulate JL'S industry	3
these terms ‘deserving’ or ‘undeserving’ are not particularly helpful	No, no. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with people making a profit	3
even if you incentivise people in those sort of way, the casualty can be the really innocent – the children	we have to look at it in that way	3
you often have public inquiries and open investigations	it’s to do with a bunch of lazy scroungers dribbling on their sofas watching reflections of themselves on Jeremy Kyle	3
you must require them to work	that’s sometimes related not being in work	3
When people either knowingly, or unknowingly, get into a position where they simply cannot service the debt. And that’s where the problems start arising	Romin is overstating Romin's case, and at the same time treating young people as though they won’t cope with living in a garret, bit of poverty but I’ll get by	3
The government and the Bank of England have decided, alone among the goods, that money should have a price determined sort of Soviet style, from the centre	my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	3
I gather Dutch bankers don’t just have rules and regulations	these families, and the problems they face, have many causes, complicated, springing from social structures, cultural attitudes, all sorts of things	3
you have to follow the rules, and you have to know the rules and you have to have the power to stick to the rules	It's not a case of just legality	3
Mr Cameron does not have to answer for the decisions of, say, Lord Palmerston	they find it hard to put the two at odds, and to understand that they ought to be leaning towards the common good and not towards personal and individual interest	3
Claire’s absolutely right about that	it very much depends which side you take it,	3
we’re talking about vastly enormous interest rates	they are unethical rather than despite it	3
that might be breakdown of family, and instability, a welfare system that doesn’t promote work, an education system that doesn’t give you a chance to get a job, debt, alcohol and drugs…	there are many poor people who are not problematic at all.	3
JB does not blame the people-	there is a no utopia	3
there is value in specific cases	they’re very short-term loans	3
they are pushing	this cost is forced onto them	3
These are children  on the threshold of being taken away to live in care	there’s two questions here	3
the present government of Britain should be held responsible for responsibility for the these atrocities of its predecessor administration many decades ago	we would say freedom fighters	3
it was revealed, that for every nine jobseekers in Cardiff there was only one vacancy	Ruth would do xxx about it	3
people who don’t work, who are unemployed, are depressed.	I think you exaggerate	3
The basis of Capitalism is actually that it requires belief and trust and credit.	It doesn’t expect that if you have a false set of structures, or a false set of purposes, that everything will be fine if you just have very good individuals	3
If you look at the wider measure of all the people on benefits: the people on incapacity benefit, the people on income support as well. Actually, even all the way through the years of the debt fuelled boom we had about 5 million people effectively workless	the young guy wasn’t turning up to work on time	3
many people are working who get it	angels are very difficult to select, but it has to start at the top	3
it is imbued with geography, history and culture	They’re far more likely as a result to be unemployed in later life	3
You’ve got no capacity.	it clearly shows that Cameron hasn’t learnt any lesson from the past	3
JL's not financing lifestyles that people can't afford	it’s pushed out all other values	3
The other is to say, “Morality is a form of human flourishing, which requires transformation of social conditions.”	that’s sometimes related not being in work,	3
there has not been a transfer	they need help getting back on track	3
CG's taking the first notion of what morality is	there is a social responsibility for bringing up children appropriately	3
we need social norms and regulations to discourage dangerous debt.	there has to be a bottom line beyond which it turns into outright exploitation	3
it clearly shows that Cameron hasn’t learnt any lesson from the past	Britain is actually very unusual compared to other countries	3
poverty is the cause of multiple disadvantage / poverty is the result of multiple disadvantage	There are problems in the education system, problems of underperformance, problems in the employment market	3
if Britain thinks that it can move on to an inclusive citizenship without addressing these historical relics of colonialism that continue to plague contemporary debates about citizenship then frankly it's fooling itself	people should do xxx in a place like Merthyr Tydfil	3
both sides of the transaction suffer as a result of ignoring moral hazard	the desire to work is innate	3
consumers should have all the information that they need	there are two other brackets that I would bring within the troubled family scenario	3
it’s not going to have the effect that Cameron believes that it will	the legacy of colonialism for white people is white privilege in the modern day setting.	3
if the best way of making money is to encourage people to take out debts that they can’t afford, the best way to make money is to encourage people to take out mortgages they can’t afford, then that is what capitalism has reverted to	that’s a hard concept to get hold of in a very individualised society	3
the wrong investments are made	Rules are what determine morality	3
theres' nothing wrong with doing the British thing, owning up and paying up	we’re talking about the general sort of, philosophical underpinning of this.	3
we’ve stopped thinking of morality as something continuous, something that permeates your whole life, your whole work.	there are many examples in society where these codes of proper conduct have continued	3
we actually encourage people to become dependent on the state	Only a desperate person would agree to pay the sort of exorbitant interest rates that are applied by the people JL represents	3
there is something wrong with people saying, “I want to go on holiday and I'm going to take out a loan for it. And I think I can pay that back.”	I don’t get this concept of systemic	3
If we want to live in a Liberal society that is also tolerant, we must have a set of principles that we all digest and understand, that ground and explain, and justify why we behave as we do	there is a problem with the way in which, specifically the City of London, has become so large in our economy, out of all proportion to the other things.	3
we’ve stopped thinking of morality as something continuous, something that permeates your whole life, your whole work.	we cannot take away the fact that these were people who were simply fighting to reclaim their lost lands	3
key thing in British society is the horror at the violence of the Mau Mau which is profoundly shocking	I think that we’re on a loser if we think that we’re going to get out of this by any kind of decline in individualism	3
Unfortunately I just don’t think we can get away from the inherent complexity here, which is that rules can sometimes be good things and they can sometimes be bad things, but so can social norms	the poor are in the most disadvantaged of all positions.	3
there are lots of other people who are lenders too	as part of that programme, Helen would say that Helen does have a remit to ask parents to consider what having another child would mean for them, and to get them to consider the opportunities for contraception	3
they take us to questions we have still got to resolve.	many people are unable to make ends meet and are having to take debt out at huge levels of interest.	3
For decades, our children have been taught nothing other than the Empire was uniquely dreadful	Claire's argued that we should build over green belt	3
the welfare state, as it is, is a safety net / is a trap	there are many families bringing up children without fathers very well.	3
they're being misled	youth unemployment is a blight on our nation	3
what this initiative is about doing, is to work with these small numbers of families with very complex needs	Christian tries  to reform individuals	3
It is a very, very rough estimate of the number of families in 2004 which had 5 of 7 deprivations: no one is in work; overcrowded housing; parents have no qualifications; mother has mental health problems; at least one parent has long standing limiting illness, disability or infirmity; the family has a low income; and the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items	if you were a Martian, and you descended and looked at what’s going on at the moment, the first thing you would say is that the lenders are being under-rewarded, not that the borrowers are being fleeced.	3
people have run up lots of debt, are paying very low rates of interest, and they’re able to continue to live in houses that they can’t afford to pay for.	if it's such an exploitative thing, there should not be outrage	3
lending money at interest isn't shameful	Helen would go and work in families’ homes, working alongside them to achieve change, and that change would be around improving the circumstances for their children, and making them safe	3
it all changed when xxx	Other companies, other organisations, have a sense of mission and also they have bosses who kind of know what’s going on.	3
they should be tried	No parent in the family is in work;	3
I think it’s not going to help change the culture	Pensions mis-selling for example, hidden credit card charges	3
We’re talking about dysfunctional families	Royal Mail ran a scheme at Christmas, applying for seasonal work	3
It raises living standards	It may be that it’s a perfectly decent product	3
Christian tries to reform individuals within a family context	they might not find it coercive	3
the Hola circumstances and the shock did not change the public consciousness about ourselves as an imperial power,and realised it was morally unsustainable from then onwards	this argument as benefits somehow taking people out of jobs, or disincentivising people simply doesn’t work	3
In general, society does	most people put more effort into choosing the coffee shop that they buy their coffee from than which bank they put their life savings in	3
it would not be okay under these circumstances for, say, a holocaust victim to take a civil damages case against Angela Merkel	That would be the normality	3
the same is true for hospitals and schools and journalism	It’s created a lot of victims who now need help themselves, and who sometimes go on to create other victims through crime	3
they have many more clients that are not as extreme, as the Government would see it	there’s certain people you just say, “You shouldn’t have children, you’re not fit to have children”	3
If you take the classic Louise Casey situation: a mother, serially deprived, not been parented herself, can’t look after her child, the child is truanting, the child’s getting into crime, the mother has mental health problems, the mother is abused, non-domination has nothing do with it	I think the model of the ‘hidden hand’ has been vastly overplayed.	3
people would require the social context in which work happens	the impact that investment banking has is so big	3
there is a deep moral instinct which says that the whole business of lending and borrowing is a highly moral area, or, if you like, a dangerous moral area	We’ve had a welfare system now for decades that says, “We will pay you more to be on benefits than to take work.”	3
they have to look at the interests of the child, and to have a debate about the environment in which you bring children into the world	In every walk of life what really work, even in the economy, is when you negotiate what is reciprocally in your joint interests	3
If there were twice as many jobs available than there are now, unemployment would fall drastically	I think there is a cultural problem within that, but I don’t think that offsets completely the positive attributes of an investment bank.	3
the Christian faith like the Islamic faith has an account of the way these things should be socially organised	when it reduces by 90%- what Neil meant is that they were all in low paid, part time jobs	3
there’s been a transfer	Lawrence James wants to muddy the waters	3
MP and RL’re talking here about poor people being moral agents,	Ruth has an objection to an intervention on the basis of people being poor, as opposed to an intervention on the basis of children genuinely being at risk of neglect or harm	3
they have many more clients that are not as extreme, as the Government would see it	Rules are what determine morality	3
JB doesn't start from that position	the fundamental message of consumer capitalism is one which says, “Forget deferred gratification. Forget endeavour. Buy it now.”	3
you say, “You get benefits on the basis that you work.”	if Ruth keeps going like that, we won’t find any at all	3
This was a war of liberation	they're easily seduced into acting, in the short-term, in ways which aren’t very good for them in the long-term	3
And the problem is, as we have things at the moment, with inflation so high and interest rates at rock bottom, savers are seeing their money taken away from them	the welfare system is the problem	3
you’ve got about 30% of claimants who’ve got some sort of attitudinal problem	if you were a Martian, and you descended and looked at what’s going on at the moment, the first thing you would say is that the lenders are being under-rewarded, not that the borrowers are being fleeced.	3
even if this hearing itself or the damages claims by these three individuals are concerned, it should / should not be the occasion for examining the colonial legacy	I think it’s not going to help change the culture	3
you famously welcomed the Occupy protesters to St Paul’s Cathedral	the Jewish community was shipped to Auschwitz	3
It was a state mechanism to compensate for that, that we have this	It’s a virtue	3
it is also very much a trap	I don’t think that there is an ethical regulation	3
Owen seems to be finding every which way not to answer Anne's very sensible question	Whether it means interfering in those families being able to conduct a flourishing life; whether it’s intervening in their property, in their bodily integrity; in their mental wellbeing by continuous harassment or nuisance.	3
it creates these disincentives	in a situation, rather than taking benefits, rather than giving a speech, what I should do is I’ll do anything. I’ll take any bits and jobs I’ll do anything because I’m not going to be dependent, either on my parents or on the State; I want to grow up, be independent. I don’t want to be beholden to the State. I don’t want to sit there passively, and I’ll take a low paid, part time job	3
Many people would raise their eyebrows at the idea that investment banks are successful in terms of managing risks.	the figures are a moral issue	3
that’s a judgment that one might have	many of the families they have to teach them how to have fun, and enjoy their children	3
No parent in the family is in work;	that is a worthwhile ambition	3
It doesn't presuppose a God	Claire's argued that we should build over green belt	3
it could not possibly follow from this very deleterious account of colonialism that JA has just given	the welfare system is the problem	3
the welfare system is the problem	they’re going to try and serve its purposes	3
somehow bankers want people to get into excessive debt	Lawrence James wants to muddy the waters	3
xxx is the template the Government is seeking to replicate	I think that the government has a very strong role in that.	3
the idea behind it was that it would be for periods of sporadic unemployment	they are the home of continuing morality in some ways	3
They don’t explain what ethical behaviour is,	It seems to be a mixture of arrogance and absurdity	3
this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	society benefits / suffers	3
that’s a crucial difference	there is no analogy between the way a company would use rewards to push forward good employees and not other employees.	3
The welfare state that we have at the moment here lacks a sense of ‘just desert’	If you took the people around this table this evening, and you took away all of our contacts, our qualifications our great jobs and so on, we’d still have more internal resources than that guy	3
these things are in some sort of a balance	Esther would not be also happy for them to face trial for atrocities committed against white settlers and British service personnel at the time	3
Debt is used time and again as a set of economic decisions, and political decisions, to achieve certain things in society	JB's no idea whether it’s innate	3
the debate about whether the State stepping in telling people to have children or not, is not the debate tonight	I want to live in a London that doesn’t have high levels of homelessness	3
That would be a baseline, that children are actually safe	there’s no chance	3
It is / is not JA's view that the history of colonialism, maybe the history of slavery, is responsible for racism in Britain	a country can even say, “We’re going to go bankrupt. It’s humiliating. We’ll do it. We’ll start again. We’ll grow	3
you can see the curves moving together	that probably isn't enough for JA	3
Ethical investment banking is a bit like tasteful lap dancing, you know, a kind of contradiction in terms.	it's a symbolic case, to open a wider door	3
AB talks about neutrality as a principle	The regulations have been over-hauled three times in the last decade	3
It creates a dependency on work	terrible harm it’s done	3
we should move towards a system which is more based on what you deserve	by and large a large chunk of the codes of ethics – as they’re supposedly called – actually protects shareholders and doesn’t protect customers.	3
we had money lenders from one religious persuasion unable to lend to their own persuasion, but happily would lend to those of another religious persuasion	No, no, no. I think there are good and bad. I wasn’t talking about the people; I’m talking about systemic.	3
MB's been reviewing it.	the push is coming from the people with the money	3
the debts that are owed now, by us as a country, even if not individually, are a result of the fact that the banks have got off Scot free	it's not innate	3
the point about a welfare state is it was set up as a safety net, during a time of near full employment	they are effectively trying to hand over to some kind of stable rule	3
that’s where we can start asking the questions	the areas of their life you intervene on, in order to bring about change are xxx	3
when news first came of the horrific massacre of Mau Mau prisoners in Kenya. Wide swathes of British public opinion and the media and the Prime Minister and most of the Cabinet were horrified and disgusted then, not now, then	it keeps them happy	3
the problem of social justice is these 120,000 families	We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content	3
CF is worried about this debate leading to the pathologising of feckless behaviour by individuals, rather than a more balanced discussion.	he half did	3
If you took the people around this table this evening, and you took away all of our contacts, our qualifications our great jobs and so on, we’d still have more internal resources than that guy	things start going wrong when you depress the price of money	3
the legacy of colonialism for white people is white privilege in the modern day setting.	That's what drove it	3
That’s the definition that the Government is using	that's MT's opinion	3
There are a number of people competing for work	that is neither a moral nor a practical way forward	3
No, no, no. I think there are good and bad. I wasn’t talking about the people; I’m talking about systemic.	it’s produced terrible harm	3
a punitive welfare state, a welfare state which attempts to socially engineer, attempts to prod and poke people ‘carrot and stick’ into work, is not sufficient to break this apparent perceived cycle	there’s a risk.	3
it was a struggle of liberation	It’s not about bad apples, that always seems to be a bit of a distraction that you just focus on a few individuals.	3
it sort of goes back to the hypothetical couple living with their parents that Cameron spoke about in his speech on Monday. This couple who will say to Romin that I’m very angry that Romin sees these other people	I think the problem is much more complicated than that	3
Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	by and large a large chunk of the codes of ethics – as they’re supposedly called – actually protects shareholders and doesn’t protect customers.	3
There is an advantage to oaths that we should realise, that we should recognise	the government guarantees your welfare in old age	3
that’s sometimes related not being in work,	they're easily seduced into acting, in the short-term, in ways which aren’t very good for them in the long-term	3
You may have more or less of it, the scale may shift, the relativities may shift, but you do have poverty to deal with.	it is true	3
you’ve got to be careful.	the investment banks because the global economy is big. If you want to cut the investment banking industry down to size, slash the global economy – it’s not a terribly great idea.	3
They’ve basically not been fated by that	it’s quite striking that all three witnesses, coming from very different positions, put their finger on that	3
the welfare state system is creating a whole class of work shy, people who are incentivised not to work	the free market system itself is based up on a very individualistic anthropology	3
that's a hang up Britain has got	I think that if you look at trust in the banking sector, we’ve seen that it’s been declining to very low levels	3
they’ve never had it	we had money lenders from one religious persuasion unable to lend to their own persuasion, but happily would lend to those of another religious persuasion	3
when you have incumbent governments, and they see that consumer credit boom mushrooming and mushrooming, they do xxx	If I lend you money, I'm taking a risk	3
what the Government is getting at, is that if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on.	Evidence shows that lack of marriage leads to poverty	3
That’s not good	household debt is about £55,000	3
AM had a problem with both of the big ‘isms’ in this argument.	it seems to be odd that JW talks about culture so much, and doesn’t refer to the cultural norms that are created by the dominance of those models	3
They don’t explain what ethical behaviour is,	they had to be over-hauled because xxx	3
this idea of usury has been fiddled over the years	If that’s the kind of job system that Neil wants, it seems to be a deeply immoral way of dealing with the quest of work, and how people should look at work	3
you have to follow the rules, and you have to know the rules and you have to have the power to stick to the rules	they're being misled	3
that also though goes back to the state of the economy	If you have exemplars	3
MT was told it was generally speaking a good thing	they're being misled	3
these are banking reforms, they’re not moral	whilst the African Americans are socially segregated from their American cousins, they are economically integrated	3
MP's both.	poverty is the driver of events	3
their risk is really with the government, and whether the government will intervene	when news first came of the horrific massacre of Mau Mau prisoners in Kenya. Wide swathes of British public opinion and the media and the Prime Minister and most of the Cabinet were horrified and disgusted then, not now, then	3
they’re less stupid	This is just crude Marxism	3
the only thing we hold in common is something abstract, which is money	that’s a big moral problem	3
There is plenty of evidence to say that there is depression amongst the unemployed.	You didn’t want to be a burden on the state	3
we could turn our tax credits, which aren’t really tax credits in the UK, into something you only get paid if you’re working	I think that we’re on a loser if we think that we’re going to get out of this by any kind of decline in individualism	3
Sometimes people just want to have more children, even if they can’t afford them	JB would want to abolish the welfare state altogether	3
bankruptcy is xxx	 that is not enough	3
that’s what’s trying to be addressed here.	If you look at these things, as anyone in work would look at, if you can’t afford to have children the State should not step in and say “Unconditionally, we will support you if you make the decision to have children you can’t afford”	3
these people are alive	the issue is not one of poverty and resources	3
my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	you can see the curves moving together	3
the State has taken a moral position	If there is an element of retrospective moral judgments, there are no problem with that	3
‘The Daily Telegraph’ pointed out there are 23 people chasing every job in this country	there are many other survivors who do not currently have access to justice	3
If you look at the wider measure of all the people on benefits: the people on incapacity benefit, the people on income support as well. Actually, even all the way through the years of the debt fuelled boom we had about 5 million people effectively workless	the country was responsible for what happened in a way that Britain is not responsible, collectively, in the same way, for what happened to these people.	3
If you took the people around this table this evening, and you took away all of our contacts, our qualifications our great jobs and so on, we’d still have more internal resources than that guy	they should do xxx in order to look after their children	3
you can be convicted of being racially offensive without being a racist	it was an unjust war that was being levelled against the Africans	3
RS's kind of treating them as though they’re passive recipients of something	in terms of the morality of this, we have to be careful of stigmatising debt and remember the creative aspect of credit	3
the knowledge is bounded	they don’t fit certain characteristics, such as for example, serial fatherlessness.	3
there is not a danger that we’ll actually make things worse	that’s a distinction that we’ve somehow lost	3
if you create a structure that says “Make decisions about family structures in a way that you feel benefits you”, but the state gives you a neutral level playing field, that’s a great thing	we are forced to do the analysis	3
that’s a little odd	It is / is not JA's view that the history of colonialism, maybe the history of slavery, is responsible for racism in Britain	3
CF is interested in the demoralising impact of welfarism 	Margaret Thatcher's daughter made some inappropriate comments	3
it is not moral when somebody is saying “I don’t want to move away from being dependent on other people for just any job; only a decent job with a very good wage, or an interesting job.”	in contrast to, say, America, you don't have a kind of polarisation between black and white here in the way that you do there.	3
when it reduces by 90%- what Neil meant is that they were all in low paid, part time jobs	JB likens it to a mouse trap which has a rather stale piece of cheese in it	3
if you follow this guide then everything will be alright in the world	we ask people to do nothing in return for their benefits	3
One assumes they’re not very tasteful.  	you don’t need to be working to claim it	3
Esther was also giving wider views around the importance of this case	families don't really have much agency themselves	3
that is a moral position to take	that's the great difference between the Empire and Nazism	3
It was a state mechanism to compensate for that, that we have this	we’ve stopped thinking of morality as something continuous, something that permeates your whole life, your whole work.	3
we must get back to who these families are and why they are so  dysfunctional	there's no statute of limitations for murder	3
I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	the idea that people should take any job at any wages, any conditions is an immoral position to take	3
when it reduces by 90%- what Neil meant is that they were all in low paid, part time jobs	There is lots of research been done to how cultures are being changed; it’s very difficult, but one things is very clear: if there is something rotten at the top, there is no hope for reform at the bottom	3
I would give, as one example of an organisation that’s changed, the BBC actually, which now tends to be pretty truthful even if only because it wasn’t in the past.	there are many poor people who don’t live like this	3
that’s a hard concept to get hold of in a very individualised society	my income is likely to drop	3
she has been so poorly parented	that really is outrageous	3
moral justice lies xxx when we look back at our imperial past	people should not have to pay their debts	3
I know bankers who behave absolutely splendidly	It wasn't that distant in moral terms from where we are now	3
what the Government is getting at, is that if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on.	the value of your savings is likely to be periodically inflated away	3
we need both debt and savings	we could move some of that money around so it’s less for not working and more for going into work, and supporting those people who are trying hard on low wages, and who we want to see succeed	3
the government, in 2001, announced a review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974	they are not	3
CF's got no savings	it creates these disincentives	3
these people are alive	they want voters	3
she is trying to do something about children- the whole scheme is trying to do that	My suspicion is that if you don’t, in some sense, believe in a transcendent good – in other words that there’s an objective good, that there’s an objective goal for human beings	3
this is not just saying “Social services should do it”	Mr Cameron does not have to answer for the decisions of, say, Lord Palmerston	3
it clearly shows that Cameron hasn’t learnt any lesson from the past	these people are alive	3
Lawrence James wants to muddy the waters	if you borrow some money from me, and you pay it back very quickly, the interest rate will be much higher than if you pay it back over a long period	3
In MP's long list of ills that are suffered by this family there are some things that would be justifiable grounds and other things that wouldn't be	There are a number of people competing for work	3
what it requires is that at the top of an organisation, there are angels in a certain sense	Lawrence James doesn't really like this case	3
it is reasonable to argue that given what they went through, as the closest they can get to the people who perpetrated this is the British state, indeed the state benefitted from colonialism in a variety of ways, it's reasonable that they should seek recompense from the British state	it can be dangerous, and particularly for the most vulnerable	3
people are still going to investment banks with ethical problems.	Without these things it doesn’t function.	3
it very much depends which side you take it,	when black people say, for example, Jews control the banks, that's prejudice	3
it’s / it's not a very important thing to do	this idea that because there were bad apples in the past nothing has changed for the worse, is the argument that’s used about crime; it’s a real cop out	3
They face the same risk	Investment bankers work very hard for their clients; they provide a lot of intellectual input and a lot of intellectual stimulus for the economy as a whole. They provide some positives as well.	3
we’re in a position now where there isn’t enough housing, and where actually some of the parents suggest if you’re agoraphobic you can’t go out to pay rent.	JB didn't say he wants to get rid of the welfare state, the welfare system	3
the present government of Britain should be held responsible for responsibility for the these atrocities of its predecessor administration many decades ago	One is to change the balance of or the generosity of out of work beneifts, maybe spend more on in work benefits like tax credits and so on	3
it will be an important opportunity for the individuals to make their case	Christian does not realize that it isn’t necessarily coming from a poor background that determines what happens in the future. Or in fact a wonderful loving family, you can end up as some dissipated wreck, alcoholic millionaire kid	3
I think that the government has a very strong role in that.	there are many poor people who are not problematic at all.	3
those liabilities actually transferred back to the British Government	part of the problem is the distinction people have drawn between the State and society.	3
By the 50s, the Empire is going	MP and RL’re talking here about poor people being moral agents,	3
they might find it coercive.	That’s very different from saying that there is a kind of systemic rot in banking	3
you would accept your non domination theory would fall if you were intervening for the good of those around them as well respecting their rights to be non dominated.	that’s actually coming down as a cohort effect anyway	3
there is a very important moral issue here,	it doesn’t actually answer the problem;	3
they are somehow or another demoralized and broken	that gives it its specific meaning	3
there is a lack of recognition that there’s anything sapping away at the moral of young people in particular, who are dependent on the State.	if you wanted to pay to work and to create a culture of work, it might be useful to have work in the first place, to have proper jobs at proper wages in the first place	3
we already have legislation that can deal with keeping children safe and ensuring they get to school on time	Royal Mail ran a scheme at Christmas, applying for seasonal work	3
we have a huge problem with unemployment.	they are proceeding with it	3
they are moral	SR should not be so worried about restoring stigma	3
I think it’s more a matter of trying to shape	It gives a very strong impression that you can borrow with impunity	3
What is actually happening is that people are choosing to pay down their long-term debt, their credit cards and their bank loans	then very, very quickly you’ll be lured into paying a very large charge	3
The Empire brought a lot of good things	That's not good enough	3
I would give, as one example of an organisation that’s changed, the BBC actually, which now tends to be pretty truthful even if only because it wasn’t in the past.	it is simply the case that buying a cup of coffee is something which is substantially less demanding than working up a long-term interest rate	3
Investment Banks are just too dangerous now as environments.	their risk is really with the government, and whether the government will intervene	3
it’s an interesting thought experiment to say that the young could survive on their own, because they’ve got the get up and go, and we should let the witnesses at it, is worth considering	if a child’s brought up into a poor family that that’s going to make their life worse?	3
I think in order to change investment banks you have to actually focus on not just specific rules, which in the introduction was described as ‘box ticking’,	they do need help	3
I'm not saying that	these judgments are very difficult to make	3
Anne misunderstands how housing benefit works	These things lead to poverty	3
only since the welfare state has there been permanent unemployment	the debts that are owed now, by us as a country, even if not individually, are a result of the fact that the banks have got off Scot free	3
That is interesting	the whole of their future is not being blighted, even though it might have been a horrible experience	3
people who don’t work, who are unemployed, are depressed.	You do get reparations in Germany	3
household debt is about £55,000	JL's industry should simply be ethical	3
The number of people that fall in the category that the 120,000 comes from, has been falling since 2004	we’re rather over inclined - and this is also a moral issue – to focus on the anti social behaviour of the poor, rather than the antisocial behaviour of the rich: the money laundering, the rate fixing, the tax evasion	3
this means nothing	Helen and Claire should be clear that Helen and Claire’re talking about 120,000 families	3
you would be intervening	They can be racially offensive	3
If the market doesn’t, for whatever reason never mind who’s fault it is, then the next thing that the government should do, is to provide jobs for these people to do	that’s part of the way God made people	3
lending money at interest isn't shameful	the conditions under which people live aren’t conducive to moral flourishing, and therefore what you want to do is challenge those conditions, change them	3
there’s certainly an argument to look at re-introducing a contributory principle back in to welfare. Something like the French system where if you lose your job you get 70% of your previous wage for a limited period	they’ve overcome them	3
I do not believe in free, free, free market Capitalism, as if there’s absolutely no regulation whatsoever.	I think it’s not going to help change the culture	3
it’s because of government interference	it was like living on thin air	3
we all know people who will tell you about some terribly wretched childhood that they’ve had	‘welfare to work’ creates the opposite of a dependency on welfare state	3
It’s not that CF wants to let people off the hook	there is not a danger that we’ll actually make things worse	3
There’s an upfront, and later.	if we’re in a Liberal society, as opposed to a Republican society, we might care about the principal of neutrality;	3
they are not	it’s right to intervene	3
the reason why we should care about the poor, is because the poor are really the victims of this	it seems to be odd that JW talks about culture so much, and doesn’t refer to the cultural norms that are created by the dominance of those models	3
a lot of listeners will be thinking, “What is the point of being prudent? There’s no reward for it whatsoever.”	that takes away most of the ability of society to use future income to fund an unaffordable product right now	3
there are two other brackets that I would bring within the troubled family scenario	as we saw from the emails in the Barclays, the acknowledgement people in Barclays were getting, was they were getting acknowledgement from their colleagues for their bad behaviour	3
they don’t fit certain characteristics, such as for example, serial fatherlessness.	the reality is that in the last ten or twenty years there’s been a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, and from the young to the old, and that what Neil's really trying to do is to justify that by blaming the poor for their position	3
We are here on Mandela's birthday and his leadership in relation to South Africa was one in which he sought to explore these issues, reconcile them, bring them to account, to apologise, to effect reparation where necessary, to acknowledge the crime	it is better to delay consumption in order to acquire something that you then have outright, rather than necessarily take out a debt	3
the problem we always have with debt, which SR would use rather than credit, is that ultimately there is interest.	they should do xxx in order to look after their children	3
it builds your character	the cost of bank borrowing doesn’t rise as the bank gets riskier	3
justice would look like xxx	What is vital is that people should be able to be compelled from the earliest possible stage to work	3
they will have experienced a drop of 10% overall in their living standards	That means not simply looking at the individual, but to change the conditions and provide those sorts of conditions.	3
this argument as benefits somehow taking people out of jobs, or disincentivising people simply doesn’t work	there are families that are in trouble	3
It’s more than just impact.	the welfare state should be about what people need/what they deserve	3
What is important at this point is that there has to be a serious discussion about the impact of welfarism	It’s creative	3
MB's been reading it too	Claire's a campaigner for more housing	3
we are not prosecuting crimes that were committed against these unfortunate people	if I have a child, I have to consider if I can afford the child	3
that was a label that was given to them	there is value in specific cases	3
If you take the classic Louise Casey situation: a mother, serially deprived, not been parented herself, can’t look after her child, the child is truanting, the child’s getting into crime, the mother has mental health problems, the mother is abused, non-domination has nothing do with it	you don’t need it, anyway	3
the reality is that in the last ten or twenty years there’s been a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, and from the young to the old, and that what Neil's really trying to do is to justify that by blaming the poor for their position	You take someone like Bob Diamond, in other industries he would have been sent off for two years to run branch banking so he knew more about it, before becoming a group Chief Executive.	3
That’s got nothing to do with poverty,	Christian tries to reform families, not individuals	3
atrocities should be - war crimes or atrocities perpetrated against civilians should be - justice should be done regardless of limit of time	Kenyan cannot just do little policy bits to get Kenan off the argument	3
I wasn’t suggesting that it was guilt money	people would require the social context in which work happens	3
they are pushing	not from the direction Professor Levitas’s coming from	3
they were treated in an appalling way	if you get it slightly wrong you cause yourself a major problem, and you have the Office of Fair Trading on your back straight away, as is happening now with some leaders	3
interest rates are at xxx in this country and indeed across the Eurozone	the factors will lead to this	3
There are three people who it seems very likely suffered	I don’t think that there is an ethical regulation	3
there’s some political rhetoric flying around that CG would not choose to be using.	this cost is forced onto them	3
In a sense he’s very similar to the abolition of the Board and Lodgings Allowance that Margaret Thatcher brought in at the end of the ‘80s, which obviously saw a huge spike in rough sleeping	We have a minimum wage	3
Helen is teaching people to live with their poverty, effectively	the whole of their future is not being blighted, even though it might have been a horrible experience	3
Alexander shouldn't be so politically correct	I think the way we run the economy is responsible for a decline in our morality	3
This took place in the colonial era	they are vulnerable	3
the big underlying moral problem with a debt-based free market economy is that when it goes bad, as it does tend to do, it’s always the poor that gets the blame	acknowledgment and reparation for that is the minimum moral requisite position that is required from the United Kingdom	3
nobody’s blaming the poor	if Ruth keeps going like that, we won’t find any at all	3
it wasn't	The number of people that fall in the category that the 120,000 comes from, has been falling since 2004	3
there are cases where families are harming themselves and harming others	they are moral	3
one might have moral judgement about the lives these people are living	whatever about papering over the cracks of inequality, it certainly was papering over the weakness of the productive economy	3
JB does not blame the people-	there is a very tiny minority of families that fall into that situation	3
the banks are so terrified that if they crystallise the debts their balance sheets will be insupportable.	You would think that you were imposing a kind of domination on your neighbors if you were just behaving very badly, and making everybody’s lives a misery around you	3
a punitive welfare state, a welfare state which attempts to socially engineer, attempts to prod and poke people ‘carrot and stick’ into work, is not sufficient to break this apparent perceived cycle	it’s derived again from the tendency towards bail-outs.	3
these things are in some sort of a balance	debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt	3
the culture of irresponsibility, or recklessness, around finance has been created not by people’s stupidity	that probably isn't enough for JA	3
The constant need for government to regulate JL'S industry	We had a boom that was fuelled by government spending and by debt, too much of which did not go to productive uses	3
I certainly get indirect effects; indirect goods.	the same is true for hospitals and schools and journalism	3
That’s the English public school version of morality	what AM's surely ignoring, and what so much of their discussion this evening has ignored, is that there are deserts around our country where there is just serial misery and hopelessness, and despair, and dysfunctionality	3
within that bracket Helen would certainly put families who are living with very high levels of aggression and violence, who are terrorising communities	They manage risk	3
This guy’s just a scrounger, he needs a kick up the backside to get going	it’s difficult for savers to take the high moral ground	3
Neil's not trying to justify anything	JB does not blame the people-	3
and it’s fundamentally immoral	It is about a kind of moral responsibility that the State also has, both to the next generation; to children who grew up in a situation which may set them off on a completely wrong track in life, in which people themselves are often rather miserable and trapped?	3
We need to think much harder about how we can make the benefit system, the whole welfare state much more activating, how we can help to get those people into work	What JL's financing is the ability of people to smooth out the peaks and troughs of their income and expenditure	3
we cannot for legal reasons go into sort of identifying individuals	What is important at this point is that there has to be a serious discussion about the impact of welfarism	3
there is an element in this of Christianity fetishising poverty	there’s two ways we can look at this	3
the same is true for hospitals and schools and journalism	the welfare state should be about what people need/what they deserve	3
I was suggesting something rather more optimistic; that actually banking is full of really rather splendid people.	there’s some political rhetoric flying around that CG would not choose to be using.	3
they cannot cope with the consequences of this progressive and incremental social family breakdown. 	poverty is the cause of multiple disadvantage/ poverty is the result of multiple disadvantage	3
we are getting to the point where debt is simply going out of control	the figures are a moral issue	3
they are pushing	if the State actually says that you are incapable of acting out on your lives, without us teaching you, treating you like children – in loco parentis, for the parents in this instance. Then obviously, xxx is what happens to free will then. xxx is what happens to your capacity to act on the world	3
and we ought to do the right thing	people who took the sub-prime mortgages were the beneficiaries – and now the sufferers – of a policy	3
if we’re in a Liberal society, as opposed to a Republican society, we might care about the principal of neutrality;	that helps perpetuate a very nasty culture within some of the banks	3
they will take no responsibility for society	And the problem is, as we have things at the moment, with inflation so high and interest rates at rock bottom, savers are seeing their money taken away from them	3
you can see an observable reality, is that families exist who are trouble	this whole neutrality position is a bit- just a way of getting out of the question.	3
That was the way our system was supposed to work as well	It’s what Ruth would think if Ruth lived next door	3
James and Neil’re not just welfare rangers, though they are welfare rangers	What is important at this point is that there has to be a serious discussion about the impact of welfarism	3
the system seems to be very, very heavily weighted against them.	that will help you to follow these rules	3
the young guy was smoking a lot of spliff	what the Government is getting at, is that if child doesn’t go to school, if it’s truanting, it gets into crime, it doesn’t do well at school, it doesn’t achieve, it doesn’t get a job, and so on.	3
Rules are what determine morality	in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	3
we’ll not further entrench the type of poverty	there’s a morally sapping character to that	3
they are not	they are vulnerable	3
KM's not in this business	eighteen plus're kind of overgrown children	3
debt is necessary for the economy	we do look back to the fact that people were making stirring speeches about it at the time	3
the people who are doing the lending, and doing the borrowing, are in receipt of a tax funded subsidy for that activity	they respond well to the framework in which you give them that help.	3
that's MT's opinion	the young guy wasn’t turning up to work on time	3
the growth of what Claire calls ‘welfarism’ is to do with, firstly the disappearance of so many skilled middle income jobs; and secondly due to the failure to build social housing	all that you need is a kind of credit based consumer thing	3
morally,Ruth has / has not any objection to this intervention	that’s an ‘Aunt Sally’	3
There’s 5 million people languishing on social housing waiting lists	poverty is the cause of multiple disadvantage/ poverty is the result of multiple disadvantage	3
in the sense that poverty doesn’t cause this.	It’s not about bad apples, that always seems to be a bit of a distraction that you just focus on a few individuals.	3
if a child's brought up into a poor family that's not going to make the family's life worse	bankruptcy is xxx	3
a Liberal society has an absolute moral duty to go and help those people, especially the child	there is such a lot of evidence that it does have a distorting effect	3
these things are in some sort of a balance	this is about getting children into school.	3
we are quite hung up about this	Claire would be all for reforming the welfare system and education	3
In the marketing department	she didn’t want any focus where it really counts for an awful lot of people, which is what’s going on around them.	3
the concept of shame, stigma and guilt, and responsibility and shame particularly, is / is not useful in this context	Ruth quarrelled with the statistics	3
you’re leaving out a good chunk of the world which is still sitting there in poverty and didn’t really notice the boom times that some of us had in the developed countries	By the 50s, the Empire is going	3
there is a problem with the way in which, specifically the City of London, has become so large in our economy, out of all proportion to the other things.	The people who lose money are the taxpayers	3
when you classify people as terrorists then you are seeking to dehumanise them	a punitive welfare state, a welfare state which attempts to socially engineer, attempts to prod and poke people ‘carrot and stick’ into work, is not sufficient to break this apparent perceived cycle	3
the big issue here is where the boundary should lie between the family and the State; how much the State should be allowed to, interfere is value laden, intervene.	savers have lost out	3
This was a war of liberation	The pragmatic justification is that they - if they are to take their case against anybody, we, this state, the British state now, is the closest they can get to it.	3
Ruth doesn't like the definition of troubled families, or anything much about all of this	morally,Ruth has / has not any objection to this intervention	3
Investment banks are particularly difficult environments for us to have ethical expectations.	ES has just muddled up civil and criminal cases	3
we're criticising the fireman	The outside impetus is the equivalent of your spike in the steering wheel, and I think that’s necessary.	3
a housing crisis, billions wasted on housing benefit lining the pockets of wealthy landlords because we stopped building social housing	if you borrowed £200 from me, and in 30 days time you pay back £250, the interest rate on that is 1,413.01%	3
morally,Ruth has / has not any objection to this intervention	that isn't a source of injustice	3
And the problem is, as we have things at the moment, with inflation so high and interest rates at rock bottom, savers are seeing their money taken away from them	we could turn our tax credits, which aren’t really tax credits in the UK, into something you only get paid if you’re working	3
the fourth child in David Cameron’s Chinese style three-child policy is not undeserving	they're having to rely on others	3
They do	that majority doesn't include CL	3
You didn’t want to be a burden on the state	yes you can have a different structure for the industry, but you end up back with investment banks.	3
They don’t want to stop it	MP's both.	3
that does undermine the moral fibre of a country	AM is not in the same way	3
you have to look at personal choices and responsibility, and also the conditions you create around families that lead to those decisions.	You have to enforce a culture that makes people think broadly about ethics; that has to come from both outside and inside.	3
the Christian faith like the Islamic faith has an account of the way these things should be socially organised	that would be great	3
JB would want to abolish the welfare state altogether	James is pretty clear cut, has pretty clear arguments, whether you agreed with them or not	3
they are proceeding with it	the answer is that there’s too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep	3
they’re very short-term loans	we’ve got a set of good practice parents, good practice child rearing,	3
we have a system dominated not by productive capitalism but by finance capitalism and consumer capitalism	it is simply the case that buying a cup of coffee is something which is substantially less demanding than working up a long-term interest rate	3
That is the real lived experience of ordinary working class people	acknowledgment and reparation for that is the minimum moral requisite position that is required from the United Kingdom	3
SR didn’t mean to say that, if it came across as that, at all	it was a struggle of liberation	3
we actually encourage people to become dependent on the state	there was xxx much sympathy generally around the table for Lee Jasper's view that some form of Mdeba moment, as he put it, reconciliation or acknowledgment of the sins of the past is something that we desperately require to bring about an inclusive multi-racial community	3
Housing benefit has not a debilitating ?effect	the poor are in the most disadvantaged of all positions.	3
in the end it’s culture not faith that might save us	politicians are not taking a moral stance over welfare reform	3
there are two fundamentally different moral approaches to this problem.	families don't really have much agency themselves	3
if one says that poverty is the cause then someone like RL is dooming these people to live in serial disadvantage and pass it down to their children. Which is what RL's side of the argument has done over several decades	that’s an ‘Aunt Sally’	3
every single man, woman and child in this country is now £240,000 in debt	there is one caveat	3
the issue has to do with something else than immoral behaviour	we never properly put that into operation	3
it’s judgemental	JL's industry should simply be ethical	3
and therefore the only way forward was for Britain to withdraw	even if you incentivise people in those sort of way, the casualty can be the really innocent – the children	3
it’s derived again from the tendency towards bail-outs.	that gives it its specific meaning	3
it seems to be odd that JW talks about culture so much, and doesn’t refer to the cultural norms that are created by the dominance of those models	people are still going to investment banks with ethical problems.	3
we would say freedom fighters	it’s / it's not a very important thing to do	3
we already have legislation that can deal with keeping children safe and ensuring they get to school on time	there were atrocities on both sides, including in this big group of people that Esther has just referred to	3
every intellectual, left and right, everybody went along with it	the family cannot afford a number of food and clothing items	3
Alexander shouldn't be so politically correct	these people are alive	3
The basis of Capitalism is actually that it requires belief and trust and credit.	xxx is how we deal with the fact that so many people now do seem to assume that they can have something for nothing	3
which is the supreme example of just that individualism and abstraction	there should be a window of apology and getting back to common sense.	3
the same is true for hospitals and schools and journalism	the wrong investments are made	3
they should do xxx in order to look after their children	they’re not going to do it on their own	3
James and Neil’re not just welfare rangers, though they are welfare rangers	it's not brutal enough	3
they think they’re all pretty rotten so they don’t see any particular point in moving from Barclays to Lloyds	Kenya was a brutal war,	3
that plays against Matthew's point	It can provide jobs, build affordable housing, provide decent leisure facilities, not close down libraries or swimming pools and so on	3
JB's no idea whether it’s innate	that's a hang up Britain has got	3
that it’s not the job of Government to favour or privilege any one moral view.	One of the confusing things in Britain is that actually the overwhelming majority of what we call ‘tax credits’, about 30 of the £33bn a year we spend on them is actually spent on stuff that’s actually not at all linked to being in work	3
if you borrowed £200 from me, and in 30 days time you pay back £250, the interest rate on that is 1,413.01%	there’s some very virtuous people who work in the City of London and do extraordinarily good things with their money.	3
They should actually be taking more risk and giving more money out	that help should be very carefully calibrated, to restore the capacity for independence and personal responsibility	3
a lot of listeners will be thinking, “What is the point of being prudent? There’s no reward for it whatsoever.”	you can’t blame the people who are rationally taking housing benefit when they can’t afford to pay their rent	3
it would not be okay under these circumstances for, say, a holocaust victim to take a civil damages case against Angela Merkel	the initiative is ‘troubled families’, not ‘troublesome families’.	3
They should actually be taking more risk and giving more money out	There are problems in the education system, problems of underperformance, problems in the employment market	3
the first and third witnesses didn't seem to draw much a distinction between the British Empire and the Third Reich.	it was a freedom struggle	3
it’s not a role of social workers, or any other person, to say that “You should be capped at number 3.”	these people don't exist	3
xxx is how we deal with the fact that so many people now do seem to assume that they can have something for nothing	it wants to get people in those households into school, into work, out of crime. Changing the patterns of, sometimes, a lifetime	3
many people are working who get it	nobody’s blaming the poor	3
I think that the government has a very strong role in that.	saving is morally good and can lead you to not be dependent	3
if there were twice as many jobs available, unemployment would fall drastically	you got a choice of being mollycoddled at home by your mum and dad, or you demand that you’re sustained by the State	3
That’s a very sort of, cost/benefit analysis approach to social policy and family life	There’s all sorts of things to be said for Capitalism, but Capitalism is also a dangerous thing	3
it doesn’t do something that also has an impact on everyone.	That led to new regulations in 2004, new regulations in 2006,	3
they have the opportunity now to try to seek justice	They have absolutely very little choice except to take the terms that are being offered to them	3
very often they do have responsibility for what they borrow	I want Barclays to be less able – I think they should be smaller, I want to break it up, I want to break up the investment banking from retail banking; very, very specific.	3
they suffered in the context of imprisonment possibly	we could move some of that money around so it’s less for not working and more for going into work, and supporting those people who are trying hard on low wages, and who we want to see succeed	3
First witness's not here to demonize debt	you don’t get round everything about what you should about welfare dependency and welfarism by just saying “Well I’m sorry, but I can’t deliver the revolution tomorrow.”	3
these aspects have been looked at in huge detail in the last 10 years by government, by consumer groups, by the industry, by academics	the debts that are owed now, by us as a country, even if not individually, are a result of the fact that the banks have got off Scot free	3
let’s not just call them ‘scroungers’	there was xxx much sympathy generally around the table for Lee Jasper's view that some form of Mdeba moment, as he put it, reconciliation or acknowledgment of the sins of the past is something that we desperately require to bring about an inclusive multi-racial community	3
Helen would like social workers to teach people to pay their rent on time, get children to school on time; those kinds of things	nobody’s blaming the poor	3
Ethics relies upon, in some sense, hierarchy; some hierarchical authority, and in some sense a social purpose. But actually, neither of those things exist in investment banks	what is the good life? is the question	3
the moral problem is that of how to provide incentives to get people off welfare, into work	Then that leads to poverty, and not to mention family breakdown.	3
the context for the atrocities having been carried out by agents of the British Government at the time, the context was the atrocities being carried out against them by the Mau Mau	you have to look at personal choices and responsibility, and also the conditions you create around families that lead to those decisions.	3
nearly two million people t working tax credit, which means that they are in jobs which are so badly paid that they can’t survive, that they require benefits	these judgments are very difficult to make	3
JA has heard lots of judgments of people being found guilty of uttering racially offensive remarks without themselves being what JA would call a card carrying racist	it seems entirely unclear	3
the welfare system is the problem	Liberal societies have often known that the family can be a nexus for forms of unequal opportunity	3
there is a natural and normal desire to work	everyone, from the ancients to kind of most world religions, see thrift and prudence as virtues because xxx	3
much debt is incredibly valuable.	when you have incumbent governments, and they see that consumer credit boom mushrooming and mushrooming, they do xxx	3
buy now, pay later, is the kind of core morality of consumer capitalism	it’s almost as though people won’t take account of the fact they’ve got absolutely no money	3
the point about a welfare state is it was set up as a safety net, during a time of near full employment	and we ought to do the right thing	3
one of the big initiatives that Romin's looking at, is the troubled families initiative; this idea that this hardcore of really difficult families that we need to look at	The pragmatic justification is that they - if they are to take their case against anybody, we, this state, the British state now, is the closest they can get to it.	3
the welfare state should be about what people need/what they deserve	they are not social work clients	3
people are still going to investment banks with ethical problems.	No parent in the family is in work	3
there are two other brackets that I would bring within the troubled family scenario	household debt is about £55,000	3
we don’t allow them to say things which are misleading	 that is not enough	3
it would be wonderful if politicians could just snap their fingers and create millions of jobs	that it’s not the job of Government to favour or privilege any one moral view.	3
If we live in a society where you get kudos for having just a whole lot of money, then people will pursue that	it seems to me that the City of London is now very widely – I mean, people are very, very angry about what’s happened. They’re very widely seen as almost a conspiracy against the common good in as much as there is a huge amount of greed	3
that does seem to correspond to the reality	KM said nothing of the sort	3
that in my view damns people	 that is not enough	3
That is interesting	it’s obvious	3
their risk is really with the government, and whether the government will intervene	my theory is that trust not only requires moral integrity, but also competence	3
there’s some political rhetoric flying around that CG would not choose to be using.	they are moral	3
children can be vulnerable to domination to their parents	you are on the side of the nationalist movements which replaced the British Empire	3
Banking, like so much else, has become deprofessionalised.	people are being incentivised to take huge amounts of risks, with my money.	3
what it requires is that at the top of an organisation, there are angels in a certain sense	it’s particularly morally repugnant for the State to tell us who should and shouldn’t have children	3
poverty is the result of social breakdown, not the cause.	My favourite story about that is Saint Francis of Assisi, who was so against money that he made his monks put a coin – if they got caught touching money they’d have to put a coin in their mouth and put it in a pile of dung, he hated money so much. But then when he died they build a huge great big expensive mausoleum for him on the top of the	3
one of the groups of people who were kind of interested in thrift and prudence were early productive capitalists, who established the capitalist system	since this government’s come to power they’ve tried to exploit tensions in working class Britain between the working poor and the unemployed; between the non-disabled and the disabled; between private sector workers and public sector workers	3
the young guy wasn’t turning up to work on time	a country can even say, “We’re going to go bankrupt. It’s humiliating. We’ll do it. We’ll start again. We’ll grow	3
It’s only since the state intervened that people have been uninterested in which bank they put their money in	the State is already helping them	3
MT didn't learn that in school, 40 years ago	if the welfare state did not exist and you became unemployed, and you rely on your friends and family to get by, and then someone comes along and offers you a job but it doesn’t give you more money than your family and friends are going. We would still expect you to take that job	3
the Government is deliberately using a figure which is about multiple deprivation	they’ve never had it	3
it’s not going to have the effect that Cameron believes that it will	The welfare state that we have at the moment here lacks a sense of ‘just desert’	3
in the developed world that wasn’t making enough money	they can afford to sort it out themselves	3
it would be totally different if the survivors had all died	In most other countries there’s something like an unemployment insurance	3
they will have experienced a drop of 10% overall in their living standards	there are 5 million people on the waiting list for social housing	3
That’s got nothing to do with poverty,	youth unemployment is a blight on our nation	3
it's not a very important thing to do	the colonial context is absent	3
we're criticising the fireman	it’s pushed out all other values	3
It’s not overwhelming	we are just providing the work that people want to do	3
That’s AB's sort of neutrality	It’s actually the culture of social norms which is what’s necessary for us to get this right	3
there are other things that the taxpayers get back from the welfare state.	most people put more effort into choosing the coffee shop that they buy their coffee from than which bank they put their life savings in	3
we’re here to discuss the morality	it’s not responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that	3
The reason we need these case assist because of that ambiguity	in the context of what we're talking about tonight the strange phenomenon then occurred, where the British went in denial and have been in denial ever since.	3
It was in essence a tyranny	It’s been created by a sense of impunity, of invulnerability	3
It’s fine to say to people, “You can decide what the good life is”, absolutely; autonomy, fine.	They do	3
There are a number of people competing for work	Over a million people, young people, without work, it has a scarring impact	3
there was horror at Mau Mau.	what it requires is that at the top of an organisation, there are angels in a certain sense	3
JB's never referred to them being work shy	you put a pound in	3
that’s dangerous	People move, in a life course, move in and out of work	3
JB  wouldn’t use the word ‘moral’	it was a struggle of liberation	3
you don’t need it, anyway	it is not moral when somebody is saying “I don’t want to move away from being dependent on other people for just any job; only a decent job with a very good wage, or an interesting job.”	3
it should be about a bit of both	the context is colonialism	3
it is / is not right in its strategy for tackling it	Melanie's talking about the de-incentivisation of marriage, on the basis that we can’t possibly talk about marriage as opposed to un-marriage	3
