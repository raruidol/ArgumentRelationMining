it’s quite striking that all three witnesses, coming from very different positions, put their finger on that	Claire’s absolutely right about that	3
it seems to be odd that JW talks about culture so much, and doesn’t refer to the cultural norms that are created by the dominance of those models	if the best way of making money is to encourage people to take out debts that they can’t afford, the best way to make money is to encourage people to take out mortgages they can’t afford, then that is what capitalism has reverted to	3

saving is morally good and can lead you to not be dependent	the knowledge is bounded	3
one of the problems we’re facing now is the fact that organisations, and indeed people who require debt, that what we’re doing is rolling everything over	if you put money into a building society, that would be on the basis that other people were taking the money out of the building society, to buy a house for example	3
I get loans pushed on me all the time	that’s a little odd	3
It didn’t flow into those industrial activities	in terms of the morality of this, we have to be careful of stigmatising debt and remember the creative aspect of credit	3

MT overestimates that	we have an excessive amount of lending	3
their risk is really with the government, and whether the government will intervene	Claire’s absolutely right about that	3
What JL's financing is the ability of people to smooth out the peaks and troughs of their income and expenditure	whatever about papering over the cracks of inequality, it certainly was papering over the weakness of the productive economy	3
they don’t have the security of future income that they did have before the credit crisis	this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	3

it’s part of an industrial strategy for them to do that	people are taking on too much debt because xxx	3
he was rather flattering about the virtue of putting off making buying decisions until you can actually afford it, which is a very old-fashioned virtue	xxx is how in a different system the poor would not get the blame and is how they would not come off worse	3

it’s to do with credit liberalisation in the United States.	they're absolutely right	3
buy now, pay later, is the kind of core morality of consumer capitalism	it’s (to get in debt) quite morally neutral.	3
it shouldn't be stigmatised to get into debt at all	not many people have been driven out of the houses on which they can’t afford to maintain their payments	3
if they're lenders, that implies there are borrowers	We are not facing the problem at all	3
Claire's trying to just avoid saying that saving is moral	MP's both.	3

it’s quite striking that all three witnesses, coming from very different positions, put their finger on that	there should be both savers and borrowers, naturally	3
it’s derived again from the tendency towards bail-outs.	MT has got to look at the underlying economic incentives	3
one of the groups of people who were kind of interested in thrift and prudence were early productive capitalists, who established the capitalist system	there should be both savers and borrowers, naturally	3
that is not irresponsible	we have an excessive amount of lending	3
There is absolute impunity for lenders at that level	The government comes and bails me out	3
they don’t have the security of future income that they did have before the credit crisis	they're not absolutely right	3
debt is morally neutral	this activity is not taking advantage of people in a moment of great weakness	3
the reason that so many people have defaulted on their mortgages is a result of tens of thousands of random decisions by individuals?	we have a system dominated not by productive capitalism but by finance capitalism and consumer capitalism	3
Somehow there was an extraordinary sea change, in which acquiring debt not only lost the stigma that it had before but became actually the thing to do	Their monthly incomes vary enormously	3
household debt is about £55,000	lending money at interest isn't shameful	3
That is the source of the subsidy in the lending world, in banking	there’s a massive moral issue as well	3
some of them had a whale of a time	And the problem is, as we have things at the moment, with inflation so high and interest rates at rock bottom, savers are seeing their money taken away from them	3
what this needs is not simply us putting moral blame on one side or the other, but actually putting moral blame on a set of economic policies and political decisions that have led to credit liberalisation.	the reason Dante confined them to the lowest circle of hell is because they made a big profit at the expense of very poor people, which was widely regarded as shameful	3
In general, society does	bankruptcy is xxx	3
that’s within a much wider social context, wherein those individual decisions are mediated	They want voters who feel artificially rich	3
it’s so insulting	It’s been created by a sense of impunity, of invulnerability	3
CF went to a lot of conferences, with a lot of policy people, who said, “We are living in a new era, the knowledge economy. We don’t have to produce anything anymore. Guess what? I mean, we can...”	MP has some savings, and MP has some borrowings as well .	3
this is quite a tricky discussion	what the Jubilee Debt Campaign says is that this isn’t simply a matter of individual morality	3
this cost is forced onto them	their risk is really with the government, and whether the government will intervene	3
we had money lenders from one religious persuasion unable to lend to their own persuasion, but happily would lend to those of another religious persuasion	you can’t say saving is morally good necessarily	3
their deposits are guaranteed	we need social norms and regulations to discourage dangerous debt.	3
it’s derived again from the tendency towards bail-outs.	there’s been 100 billion pounds transfer from savers to borrowers	3
this activity is not taking advantage of people in a moment of great weakness	That would be the normality	3
if you get it slightly wrong you cause yourself a major problem, and you have the Office of Fair Trading on your back straight away, as is happening now with some leaders	it’s (to get in debt) quite morally neutral.	3
if you borrow some money from me, and you pay it back very quickly, the interest rate will be much higher than if you pay it back over a long period	somehow bankers want people to get into excessive debt	3
society benefits/ society suffers	MP's both.	3
most people put more effort into choosing the coffee shop that they buy their coffee from than which bank they put their life savings in	we do have a culture of profligacy and fecklessness	3
We had a boom that was fuelled by government spending and by debt, too much of which did not go to productive uses	they are vulnerable	3
the culture of irresponsibility, or recklessness, around finance has been created not by people’s stupidity	if you’ve got money you can get more money	3
they want voters	you don’t need it, anyway	3
what has driven a great deal of the problems that we’ve got now is the need for capital to find new ways of making money	the debts that are owed now, by us as a country, even if not individually, are a result of the fact that the banks have got off Scot free	3
In some ways you need that discipline, to be a saver, to think, “I won’t get into debt”	saving is morally good and can lead you to not be dependent	3
if ND's going to raise his banner for anybody who’s doing badly in this situation, he should have raised it for savers, in the first instance	people who took the sub-prime mortgages were the beneficiaries – and now the sufferers – of a policy	3
it is xxx about JL's industry that leads him to want to pull the wool over people’s eyes	Their monthly incomes vary enormously	3
thrift is a perfectly sensible thing to do	bankruptcy used to be shameful	3
we’re talking about vastly enormous interest rates	It is the case that some of the greatest examples of social progress over the years have come from well-off rich people, banks and so on, investing productively	3
if you borrowed £200 from me, and in 30 days time you pay back £250, the interest rate on that is 1,413.01%	it’s (to get in debt) quite morally neutral.	3
the problem we always have with debt, which SR would use rather than credit, is that ultimately there is interest.	The government and the Bank of England have decided, alone among the goods, that money should have a price determined sort of Soviet style, from the centre	3
three of the witnesses, coming from what MP took to be different political positions, did arrive at the point that there has been an intervention by government which is at the heart of the problem	thrift and prudence are virtues	3
What JL's financing is the ability of people to smooth out the peaks and troughs of their income and expenditure	all that you need is a kind of credit based consumer thing	3

people should not have to pay their debts	society benefits/ society suffers	3
JL is actually financing consumer spending, as opposed to investment	We’re pretending the problem isn’t there	3
the lenders are actually the banks, that are at the pinnacle of our society	if you get into debt, and you can never get out of it, that’s slavery	3
it depends on the environment	if we’re going to discuss morality, we have to discuss the immorality of political leaders.	3
That would be the normality	MT overestimates the role of ideas in these matters	3
what SR doesn't want to see is a return necessarily to debtors’ prison	It used to be, when SR was younger, when his parents and grandparents were around, that saving was the moral thing to do	3
the history of the financial services industry demonstrates that this is an industry with a deep commitment to exploiting those weaknesses, in order to make a fast buck	if they're virtues, that implies that the opposite of thrift and prudence is immoral	3
Their monthly incomes vary enormously	There is absolute impunity for lenders at that level	3
there is too much debt because xxx	if you get it slightly wrong you cause yourself a major problem, and you have the Office of Fair Trading on your back straight away, as is happening now with some leaders	3

The constant need for government to regulate JL'S industry	The regulations have been over-hauled three times in the last decade	3
that’s a distinction that we’ve somehow lost	it’s the poor who suffer	3
People are no more stupid now than they were 150 years ago	it made CL feel very uncomfortable in a sort of moral kind of way	3
there's no morality in that	a lot of listeners will be thinking, “What is the point of being prudent? There’s no reward for it whatsoever.”	3
if you borrow some money from me, and you pay it back very quickly, the interest rate will be much higher than if you pay it back over a long period	the wrong investments are made	3
JL's industry should simply be ethical	this activity is, in fact, taking a very unfair advantage of people in a moment of great weakness	3
it is a reasonable thing for the state to intervene in those cases	They’re stingy, not everybody is stingy	3
in the current situation both savers and borrowers are doing extremely badly	every intellectual, left and right, everybody went along with it	3
debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt	First witness made a very nuanced case	3
We’re talking hundreds, if not thousands, of per cent	it’s not necessarily solely a moral question	3
buy now, pay later, is the kind of core morality of consumer capitalism	it’s difficult for savers to take the high moral ground	3
We don’t allow fatty products to say they're healthy	there's no morality in that	3
the wrong investments are made	the problem is that many people, either knowingly or because credit cards were being thrust at them, have taken on debts they can’t possibly hope to pay	3
It’s going to have to find someone who will borrow it	household debt is about £55,000	3
we have an excessive amount of lending	both sides of the transaction suffer as a result of ignoring moral hazard	3
people should not have to pay their debts	that is a case of some paternalism	3
it’s the poor who suffer	They get nothing out of it	3
there is/ is not a moral distinction between the two	it depends on the environment	3
there should be both savers and borrowers, naturally	It can be a way of demonstrating independence	3
underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you’ll be paying all sorts of charges	they're easily seduced into acting, in the short-term, in ways which aren’t very good for them in the long-term	3
it is a reasonable thing for the state to intervene in those cases	interest rates are being kept really low, in order that borrowers won’t bear the consequences of their foolish borrowing.	3
quite broadly in society, some of the problems we have is that behaviours which are self-destructive, and also anti-social, are not stigmatised	First witness didn’t overdo it on making a virtue of savings	3
It was their avoidance of being democrats and trying to win us politically	since the rise of consumer capitalism we’ve had a very, very different kind of message	3
savers have lost out	three of the witnesses, coming from what MP took to be different political positions, did arrive at the point that there has been an intervention by government which is at the heart of the problem	3
it’s a very odd idea	you do actually want to say, “Money doesn’t grow on trees.”	3
JL is actually financing consumer spending, as opposed to investment	if you add up all the debt, from all the sectors in the economy, we’re actually having 10 times our annual income	3
You don’t pay an interest rate	the problem is that’s been the policy for the last three decades, to encourage huge amounts of borrowing to keep the economy going	3
quite broadly in society, some of the problems we have is that behaviours which are self-destructive, and also anti-social, are not stigmatised	The constant need for government to regulate JL'S industry	3
society benefits/ society suffers	JL doesn’t buy that at all	3
all that happens is it’s getting much, much worse	if you want the moral hazard, instead of kind of just going on about the bankers, there is a danger that if we just said we’d write off debt, that it actually isn’t very helpful for our side, for ordinary people, to actually have that	3
JL's actually financing lifestyles that people can’t actually afford	CF is worried about this debate leading to the pathologising of feckless behaviour by individuals, rather than a more balanced discussion.	3
we are getting to the point where debt is simply going out of control	culture follows economics	3
bankers went to great lengths to advertise how prudent they were	you start again with some very strict rules and a stigma.	3
People are no more stupid now than they were 150 years ago	the big underlying moral problem with a debt-based free market economy is that when it goes bad, as it does tend to do, it’s always the poor that gets the blame	3
a country can even say, “We’re going to go bankrupt. It’s humiliating. We’ll do it. We’ll start again. We’ll grow	the knowledge is bounded	3
not all debt is bad	they are vulnerable	3
The interest rate varies by the amount of the charge for the credit but also the time over which you repay it	quite broadly in society, some of the problems we have is that behaviours which are self-destructive, and also anti-social, are not stigmatised	3
MT overestimates the role of ideas in these matters	that is a case of some paternalism	3
bankruptcy is xxx	savers have lost out	3
since the rise of consumer capitalism we’ve had a very, very different kind of message	The interest rate varies by the amount of the charge for the credit but also the time over which you repay it	3
people have / do not have to have that	things start going wrong when you depress the price of money	3
They’re completely negligent in this area	it can be dangerous, and particularly for the most vulnerable	3
Pensions mis-selling for example, hidden credit card charges	you start again with some very strict rules and a stigma.	3
it all changed when xxx	When you think about it now, CF finds it frustrating when she's trying to talk to people about the real state the economy is in	3
we have to regulate it	if you borrow some money from me, and you pay it back very quickly, the interest rate will be much higher than if you pay it back over a long period	3
the knowledge is bounded	JL's industry should not need to be wrapped up in red tape	3
It didn’t flow into those industrial activities	it’s to do with credit liberalisation in the United States.	3
the government guarantees your welfare in old age	People are no more stupid now than they were 150 years ago	3
JL's not financing lifestyles that people can't afford	It’s a bit like saying wearing a jumper is moral	3
they are lenders	JL should be worried that he's taking advantage of people when they are really in no position to negotiate	3
And if you suppress it, then in fact you're in a situation where the wealth that you look like you're generating is fool’s gold, not real wealth at all.	if they're virtues, that implies that the opposite of thrift and prudence is immoral	3
this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	In the marketing department	3
a country can even say, “We’re going to go bankrupt. It’s humiliating. We’ll do it. We’ll start again. We’ll grow	whatever about papering over the cracks of inequality, it certainly was papering over the weakness of the productive economy	3
MT overestimates that	the main conversation is, “How do we do compliant adverts?”	3
CL's not in debt at the moment	that also though goes back to the state of the economy	3
JL's industry should not need to be wrapped up in red tape	a lot of people are making no provision for their future	3
there are about six times more savers than borrowers	consumers should have all the information that they need	3
In some ways you need that discipline, to be a saver, to think, “I won’t get into debt”	one that ought to, at least to some extent, be resurrected	3
First witness didn’t overdo it on making a virtue of savings	the problem we always have with debt, which SR would use rather than credit, is that ultimately there is interest.	3
credit raises living standards	A lot of savers have spent much of their life putting money by, in the hope that they can provide for themselves in their old age.	3
one that ought to, at least to some extent, be resurrected	the reason Dante confined them to the lowest circle of hell is because they made a big profit at the expense of very poor people, which was widely regarded as shameful	3
the culture of irresponsibility, or recklessness, around finance has been created not by people’s stupidity	this cost is forced onto them	3
it was like living on thin air	it can be dangerous, and particularly for the most vulnerable	3
people aren’t very good at understanding financial products	if we’re going to discuss morality, we have to discuss the immorality of political leaders.	3
every few years JL's industry finds a new way of preying on people’s inability really to understand complex financial products	you’d not use that argument to explain the reason, for example, why we have an increase in obesity, and claim that the supermarkets are exploiting people’s desire for food	3
It’s a bit like saying wearing a jumper is moral	MT's got all the information there in front of him	3
This stopped not because of the big bang, which liberalised banking, which is what everybody thinks	I get loans pushed on me all the time	3
Their monthly incomes vary enormously	this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	3
the cost of bank borrowing doesn’t rise as the bank gets riskier	that is totally untrue	3
where First witness and CF kind of wanted to talk about economic policy they would have agreed on a lot of things	very often they do have responsibility for what they borrow	3
the government, in 2001, announced a review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974	in South Korea, in terms of how South Korean grew, it did incentivise saving, at certain times, by certain economic policies	3
bankers went to great lengths to advertise how prudent they were	we have a system dominated not by productive capitalism but by finance capitalism and consumer capitalism	3
they are choosing to borrow small amounts of money for short periods of time	Otherwise you’ve got slavery.	3
this is quite a tricky discussion	MB could see First witness and CF kind of veering	3
quite broadly in society, some of the problems we have is that behaviours which are self-destructive, and also anti-social, are not stigmatised	everyone who puts money into a bank, or a building society, is putting it there so that the bank can lend it on	3
it made CL feel very uncomfortable in a sort of moral kind of way	this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	3
he was rather flattering about the virtue of putting off making buying decisions until you can actually afford it, which is a very old-fashioned virtue	They do	3
the economy is in such a terrible state that in order to expand the economy, and get us out of this crisis, we have to encourage people to borrow.	there’s a massive moral issue as well	3
It can’t just sit there	The people who lose money are the taxpayers	3
entrepreneurs could get the credit	if they're lenders, that implies there are borrowers	3
they had to be over-hauled because xxx	they're in debt	3
one of the reasons people aren’t thrifty in Britain is because they benefit from all sorts of guarantees	all debt is not immoral.	3
Their monthly incomes vary enormously	they’re very short-term loans	3
the dismantling of those social norms, and those laws, have made us vulnerable	these aspects have been looked at in huge detail in the last 10 years by government, by consumer groups, by the industry, by academics	3
thrift and prudence are not virtues	the people who are doing the lending, and doing the borrowing, are in receipt of a tax funded subsidy for that activity	3
they're absolutely right	if you’ve got money you can get more money	3
Simply	in the current situation both savers and borrowers are doing extremely badly	3
you can’t say saving is morally good necessarily	First witness's not here to demonize debt	3
MT overestimates that	It’s only since the state intervened that people have been uninterested in which bank they put their money in	3
the problem we always have with debt, which SR would use rather than credit, is that ultimately there is interest.	Only a desperate person would agree to pay the sort of exorbitant interest rates that are applied by the people JL represents	3
MT overestimates that	it’s almost as though people won’t take account of the fact they’ve got absolutely no money	3
in South Korea, in terms of how South Korean grew, it did incentivise saving, at certain times, by certain economic policies	every intellectual, left and right, everybody went along with it	3
CF's definitely more in debt	In some ways you need that discipline, to be a saver, to think, “I won’t get into debt”	3
there are about six times more savers than borrowers	it can be dangerous, and particularly for the most vulnerable	3
that does undermine the moral fibre of a country	the government, in 2001, announced a review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974	3
First witness made a very practical case about what’s happened if you’ve got savings	Their monthly incomes vary enormously	3
some of them had a whale of a time	somehow bankers want people to get into excessive debt	3
they are pushing	a young person decides to take out a mortgage, which is taking out a massive debt, so that they don’t have to be dependent on their parents, or don’t have to be maybe dependent on a council house. It’s a sign of independence.	3
a lot of people are making no provision for their future	Claire's trying to just avoid saying that saving is moral	3
interest rates are at xxx in this country and indeed across the Eurozone	what has driven a great deal of the problems that we’ve got now is the need for capital to find new ways of making money	3
If you want the economy to run smoothly, you have to incentivise certain types of behaviour.	what has driven a great deal of the problems that we’ve got now is the need for capital to find new ways of making money	3
CL's not in debt at the moment	as a society we had created a set of social norms and values which protected us from our innate short-termism	3
you could say that at the moment one of the problems is that there’s not enough credit being released creatively	if you borrowed £200 from me, and in 30 days time you pay back £250, the interest rate on that is 1,413.01%	3
JL's industry wants to comply with the regulations that others have determined. Not just in the UK, but in the whole of the EU	That would be the normality	3
society benefits / suffers	that is a case of some paternalism	3
people have / do not have to have that	MT's got all the information there in front of him	3
they're not absolutely right	Somehow there was an extraordinary sea change, in which acquiring debt not only lost the stigma that it had before but became actually the thing to do	3
savers need saving because xxx	we aren't even facing up to the actual problem	3
you’ve got 14.2 million people who are self-employed, lots of people working shifts, working part-time, relying on commissions and bonuses.	thrift and prudence are virtues	3
People are no more stupid now than they were 150 years ago	this was compensation for the fact that actually there was sluggish, slow, productive growth, that was then sold somehow as, “Well yes, but everything’s okay because we’ll fuel a consumer cross talking [0:38:41].”	3
what JL's doing is providing small loans, for short periods of time, to help them smooth out their family income	their deposits are guaranteed	3
they're not absolutely right	we need both debt and savings	3
a lot of listeners will be thinking, “What is the point of being prudent? There’s no reward for it whatsoever.”	the problem is that the only thing the banks have done is kind of consumer credit	3
it is a reasonable thing for the state to intervene in those cases	People are no more stupid now than they were 150 years ago	3
First witness made a very practical case about what’s happened if you’ve got savings	There is absolute impunity for lenders at that level	3
The problem is that so much debt has been acquired that has gone towards non-productive usage	First witness's not here to demonize debt	3
people have run up lots of debt, are paying very low rates of interest, and they’re able to continue to live in houses that they can’t afford to pay for.	This stopped not because of the big bang, which liberalised banking, which is what everybody thinks	3
some of them had a whale of a time	they will only do it if they are regulated	3
in terms of the morality of this, we have to be careful of stigmatising debt and remember the creative aspect of credit	xxx is how we deal with the fact that so many people now do seem to assume that they can have something for nothing	3
these companies, in their marketing departments, sit down and say to themselves, “When we’re advertising our products, we should make sure that consumers really, really, really understand what they’re getting in for”?  / they sit down and think, “How can we get customers to buy our products, by putting in the shop window the most generous possible figures in the hope that they won’t understand that that’s just an offer to lure them in”?	it’s / it's not a very important thing to do	3
every intellectual, left and right, everybody went along with it	every single man, woman and child in this country is now £240,000 in debt	3
What they should have been doing, what they could be doing, and what they haven’t got the nerve to do, is not loaning enough	In some ways you need that discipline, to be a saver, to think, “I won’t get into debt”	3
we are getting to the point where debt is simply going out of control	debt is necessary for the economy	3
the economy is in such a terrible state that in order to expand the economy, and get us out of this crisis, we have to encourage people to borrow.	In some ways you need that discipline, to be a saver, to think, “I won’t get into debt”	3
in terms of the morality of this, we have to be careful of stigmatising debt and remember the creative aspect of credit	there are about six times more savers than borrowers	3
that’s within a much wider social context, wherein those individual decisions are mediated	in terms of the morality of this, we have to be careful of stigmatising debt and remember the creative aspect of credit	3
we have to change the nature of the financial system and the economy	xxx is the nature of the conversation in the marketing departments	3
every single man, woman and child in this country is now £240,000 in debt	what JL's doing is providing small loans, for short periods of time, to help them smooth out their family income	3
Debt is used time and again as a set of economic decisions, and political decisions, to achieve certain things in society	It can be a way of demonstrating independence	3
The consumer credit industry is very highly regulated	you’ve got 14.2 million people who are self-employed, lots of people working shifts, working part-time, relying on commissions and bonuses.	3
as things exist at the moment, it isn’t a matter of me deciding that I want a million different things, and I'm going to really have to go out and seek a loan	you can’t say saving is morally good necessarily	3
they’re very short-term loans	the cost of bank borrowing doesn’t rise as the bank gets riskier	3
household debt is about £55,000	MB could see First witness and CF kind of veering	3
taxpayers are pretty broad based	bankruptcy is xxx	3
First witness made a very nuanced case	xxx is who suffers most from the lack of moral hazard, the perceived lack of moral hazard	3
they're absolutely right	MP's both.	3
if you put money into a building society, that would be on the basis that other people were taking the money out of the building society, to buy a house for example	When you think about it now, CF finds it frustrating when she's trying to talk to people about the real state the economy is in	3
not all debt is bad	It used to be, when SR was younger, when his parents and grandparents were around, that saving was the moral thing to do	3
you can’t say saving is morally good necessarily	this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	3
people aren’t very good at understanding financial products	we have to regulate it	3
all that happens is it’s getting much, much worse	the problem is that’s been the policy for the last three decades, to encourage huge amounts of borrowing to keep the economy going	3
the people who are doing the lending, and doing the borrowing, are in receipt of a tax funded subsidy for that activity	that’s a distinction that we’ve somehow lost	3
Claire’s absolutely right about that	both sides of the transaction suffer as a result of ignoring moral hazard	3
if they're virtues, that implies that the opposite of thrift and prudence is immoral	it’s almost as though people won’t take account of the fact they’ve got absolutely no money	3
there are about six times more savers than borrowers	there's no morality in that	3
he half did	When people either knowingly, or unknowingly, get into a position where they simply cannot service the debt. And that’s where the problems start arising	3
they will only do it if they are regulated	society benefits / suffers	3
It’s a virtue	there’s a massive moral issue as well	3
JL's not financing lifestyles that people can't afford	The problem is that so much debt has been acquired that has gone towards non-productive usage	3
the history of the financial services industry demonstrates that this is an industry with a deep commitment to exploiting those weaknesses, in order to make a fast buck	it’s, as it were, intellectually honest to kind of play out the virtues of saving, as opposed to borrowing, when really, unless the two kind of balance out in an economy, there’s no point saving	3
whatever about papering over the cracks of inequality, it certainly was papering over the weakness of the productive economy	the fundamental message of consumer capitalism is one which says, “Forget deferred gratification. Forget endeavour. Buy it now.”	3
the underlying state of our society is highly, highly unequal.	the fact is, if living standards aren’t going up what you do is you let people borrow money	3
it’s part of an industrial strategy for them to do that	this is quite a tricky discussion	3
In some ways you need that discipline, to be a saver, to think, “I won’t get into debt”	the wrong investments are made	3
The regulations have been over-hauled three times in the last decade	bankers went to great lengths to advertise how prudent they were	3
the reason that so many people have defaulted on their mortgages is a result of tens of thousands of random decisions by individuals?	MB could see First witness and CF kind of veering	3
they will take no responsibility for society	what SR doesn't want to see is a return necessarily to debtors’ prison	3
xxx is the nature of the conversation in the marketing departments	as things exist at the moment, it isn’t a matter of me deciding that I want a million different things, and I'm going to really have to go out and seek a loan	3
they're easily seduced into acting, in the short-term, in ways which aren’t very good for them in the long-term	when ND comes up with this line about sub-prime debt, that this was economic policy, to push loans onto people who couldn’t afford them, the people actually accepting those loans have / have no personal responsibility of their own	3
the cost of bank borrowing doesn’t rise as the bank gets riskier	it’s almost as though people won’t take account of the fact they’ve got absolutely no money	3
their deposits are guaranteed	they're not absolutely right	3
they're absolutely right	there’s a massive moral issue as well	3
this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	the history of the financial services industry does not demonstrate that this is an industry with a deep commitment to exploiting those weaknesses	3
you’ve got 14.2 million people who are self-employed, lots of people working shifts, working part-time, relying on commissions and bonuses.	consumers should have all the information that they need	3
JL doesn’t buy that at all	Prudent/imprudent, it makes no difference to people lending their money to banks	3
you start again with some very strict rules and a stigma.	every intellectual, left and right, everybody went along with it	3
borrowers should not be doing badly	bankruptcy is xxx	3
people aren’t very good at understanding financial products	that takes away most of the ability of society to use future income to fund an unaffordable product right now	3
that’s what they get	First witness made a very practical case about what’s happened if you’ve got savings	3
They don’t want to stop it	it’s / it's not a very important thing to do	3
It may be that it’s a perfectly decent product	all debt is not immoral.	3
buy now, pay later, is the kind of core morality of consumer capitalism	if you borrow some money from me, and you pay it back very quickly, the interest rate will be much higher than if you pay it back over a long period	3
There’s no value for a banker in being prudent anymore	they had to be over-hauled because xxx	3
In general, society does	we should not just assume that people aren’t going to be suckers for such advertising	3
lending money at interest isn't shameful	entrepreneurs could get the credit	3
ND must stop attacking them and actually suggest that we want the rich to do something productive	since the rise of consumer capitalism we’ve had a very, very different kind of message	3
very often what high levels of debt can mean, and especially when the debt is on very unjust terms, is a massive redistribution of wealth in society, from the poorest to the richest.	whatever about papering over the cracks of inequality, it certainly was papering over the weakness of the productive economy	3
if ND's going to raise his banner for anybody who’s doing badly in this situation, he should have raised it for savers, in the first instance	we need both debt and savings	3
buy now, pay later, is the kind of core morality of consumer capitalism	this is the moral maze	3
they're not absolutely right	A lot of savers have spent much of their life putting money by, in the hope that they can provide for themselves in their old age.	3
the fundamentals of the economy aren’t generating what you want	as a society we had created a set of social norms and values which protected us from our innate short-termism	3
culture follows economics	the system seems to be very, very heavily weighted against them.	3
it would not be in the interest of banks to lend money to people who can’t afford to repay it. Unless the banks knew that someone else was going to meet their problem	JL should be worried that he's taking advantage of people when they are really in no position to negotiate	3
the problems we have is when debt gets out of control.	these companies, in their marketing departments, sit down and say to themselves, “When we’re advertising our products, we should make sure that consumers really, really, really understand what they’re getting in for”?  / they sit down and think, “How can we get customers to buy our products, by putting in the shop window the most generous possible figures in the hope that they won’t understand that that’s just an offer to lure them in”?	3
MP's both.	they're absolutely right	3
it can be dangerous, and particularly for the most vulnerable	both sides of the transaction suffer as a result of ignoring moral hazard	3
We had a boom that was fuelled by government spending and by debt, too much of which did not go to productive uses	They’re completely negligent in this area	3
Michael Portillo should lend Michael Buerk a fiver	that’s a big moral problem	3
We reckon something like 100 billion pounds has been transferred from savers to borrowers.	the reason banks take excessive risk is that they don’t pay the price for that risk-taking, because of the government guarantee	3
they’re not going to do it on their own	it is xxx about JL's industry that leads him to want to pull the wool over people’s eyes	3
this was compensation for the fact that actually there was sluggish, slow, productive growth, that was then sold somehow as, “Well yes, but everything’s okay because we’ll fuel a consumer cross talking [0:38:41].”	what has driven a great deal of the problems that we’ve got now is the need for capital to find new ways of making money	3
the wrong investments are made	by artificially suppressing the price of money savers were being penalised, rather than people who’ve been improvident perhaps	3
what SR doesn't want to see is a return necessarily to debtors’ prison	I get loans pushed on me all the time	3
they’re less stupid	SR didn’t mean to say that, if it came across as that, at all	3
one that ought to, at least to some extent, be resurrected	the problem is that many people, either knowingly or because credit cards were being thrust at them, have taken on debts they can’t possibly hope to pay	3
the main conversation is, “How do we do compliant adverts?”	they're easily seduced into acting, in the short-term, in ways which aren’t very good for them in the long-term	3
there is a deep moral instinct which says that the whole business of lending and borrowing is a highly moral area, or, if you like, a dangerous moral area	consumers should have all the information that they need	3
this idea of usury has been fiddled over the years	that is totally untrue	3
It’s beneficial to people	it’s, as it were, intellectually honest to kind of play out the virtues of saving, as opposed to borrowing, when really, unless the two kind of balance out in an economy, there’s no point saving	3
people have run up lots of debt, are paying very low rates of interest, and they’re able to continue to live in houses that they can’t afford to pay for.	a country can even say, “We’re going to go bankrupt. It’s humiliating. We’ll do it. We’ll start again. We’ll grow	3
they had to be over-hauled because xxx	the cost of bank borrowing doesn’t rise as the bank gets riskier	3
they want voters	We had a boom that was fuelled by government spending and by debt, too much of which did not go to productive uses	3
interest rates are being kept really low, in order that borrowers won’t bear the consequences of their foolish borrowing.	these companies, in their marketing departments, sit down and say to themselves, “When we’re advertising our products, we should make sure that consumers really, really, really understand what they’re getting in for”?  / they sit down and think, “How can we get customers to buy our products, by putting in the shop window the most generous possible figures in the hope that they won’t understand that that’s just an offer to lure them in”?	3
that has become incredibly dangerous and insupportable	We don’t allow fatty products to say they're healthy	3
we have to change the nature of the financial system and the economy	it’s been pointed out that borrowing money can have disadvantages, as well as advantages	3
not all debt is bad	what JL's doing is providing small loans, for short periods of time, to help them smooth out their family income	3
somehow bankers want people to get into excessive debt	every intellectual, left and right, everybody went along with it	3
it seems to be odd that JW talks about culture so much, and doesn’t refer to the cultural norms that are created by the dominance of those models	CF is worried about this debate leading to the pathologising of feckless behaviour by individuals, rather than a more balanced discussion.	3
there are about six times more savers than borrowers	CF is worried about this debate leading to the pathologising of feckless behaviour by individuals, rather than a more balanced discussion.	3
the fundamental message of consumer capitalism is one which says, “Forget deferred gratification. Forget endeavour. Buy it now.”	MB could see First witness and CF kind of veering	3
you’ve got 14.2 million people who are self-employed, lots of people working shifts, working part-time, relying on commissions and bonuses.	You wanted to provide for yourself	3
the banks are the lenders	SR is shying away from stigma	3
what the Jubilee Debt Campaign says is that this isn’t simply a matter of individual morality	it’s so insulting	3
people have / do not have to have that	that takes away most of the ability of society to use future income to fund an unaffordable product right now	3
JL's actually financing lifestyles that people can’t actually afford	this activity is not taking advantage of people in a moment of great weakness	3
the value of your savings is likely to be periodically inflated away	the fundamentals of the economy aren’t generating what you want	3
it’s / it's not a very important thing to do	that is totally untrue	3
They're average people on the whole	JL's industry doesn’t want to pull the wool over people’s eyes.	3
underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you’ll be paying all sorts of charges	if I want a washing machine, I have to go to the launderette every week at the moment and spend several pounds in the launderette	3
CF's got no savings	it’s derived again from the tendency towards bail-outs.	3
all debt is not immoral.	there’s been 100 billion pounds transfer from savers to borrowers	3
It was a state mechanism to compensate for that, that we have this	credit advertising is highly regulated	3
The interest rate varies by the amount of the charge for the credit but also the time over which you repay it	culture follows economics	3
CF went to a lot of conferences, with a lot of policy people, who said, “We are living in a new era, the knowledge economy. We don’t have to produce anything anymore. Guess what? I mean, we can...”	that has to be the case	3
the fact is, if living standards aren’t going up what you do is you let people borrow money	It gives a very strong impression that you can borrow with impunity	3
We don’t allow fatty products to say they're healthy	that is not irresponsible	3
It’s not that CF wants to let people off the hook	it is simply the case that buying a cup of coffee is something which is substantially less demanding than working up a long-term interest rate	3
he was rather flattering about the virtue of putting off making buying decisions until you can actually afford it, which is a very old-fashioned virtue	they are choosing to borrow small amounts of money for short periods of time	3
the history of the financial services industry does not demonstrate that this is an industry with a deep commitment to exploiting those weaknesses	people aren’t very good at understanding financial products	3
he was rather flattering about the virtue of putting off making buying decisions until you can actually afford it, which is a very old-fashioned virtue	if you get into debt, and you can never get out of it, that’s slavery	3
the underlying state of our society is highly, highly unequal.	that does undermine the moral fibre of a country	3
we don’t allow them to say things which are misleading	if you get into debt, and you can never get out of it, that’s slavery	3
they will take no responsibility for society	much debt is incredibly valuable.	3
if you just take the taxpayers, that is half a million pounds of debt that we all have	The people who lose money are the taxpayers	3
it is a reasonable thing for the state to intervene in those cases	this cost is forced onto them	3
these companies, in their marketing departments, sit down and say to themselves, “When we’re advertising our products, we should make sure that consumers really, really, really understand what they’re getting in for”?  / they sit down and think, “How can we get customers to buy our products, by putting in the shop window the most generous possible figures in the hope that they won’t understand that that’s just an offer to lure them in”?	if they're virtues, that implies that the opposite of thrift and prudence is immoral	3
the knowledge is bounded	a lot of listeners will be thinking, “What is the point of being prudent? There’s no reward for it whatsoever.”	3
the problem is that the only thing the banks have done is kind of consumer credit	the debts that are owed now, by us as a country, even if not individually, are a result of the fact that the banks have got off Scot free	3
there’s a danger when you kind of say, “The poor are the ones who suffer. The rich are the bad guys.”	that was a political strategy, a way of covering things up	3
Human beings are not very good at the long-term	SR is shying away from stigma	3
they had to be over-hauled because xxx	if ND's going to raise his banner for anybody who’s doing badly in this situation, he should have raised it for savers, in the first instance	3

this is the moral maze	in the current situation both savers and borrowers are doing extremely badly	3
you start again with some very strict rules and a stigma.	they’re descending personally into financial chaos	3
When people either knowingly, or unknowingly, get into a position where they simply cannot service the debt. And that’s where the problems start arising	In the marketing department	3
a lot of people are making no provision for their future	JL's not financing lifestyles that people can't afford	3
The consumer credit industry is very highly regulated	debt is necessary for the economy	3
the reason that so many people have defaulted on their mortgages is not the result of tens of thousands of random decisions by individuals	the history of the financial services industry demonstrates that this is an industry with a deep commitment to exploiting those weaknesses, in order to make a fast buck	3
This stopped not because of the big bang, which liberalised banking, which is what everybody thinks	there's no morality in that	3
that’s a distinction that we’ve somehow lost	people aren’t very good at understanding financial products	3
JL should be worried that he's taking advantage of people when they are really in no position to negotiate	the answer is that there’s too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep	3
all that you need is a kind of credit based consumer thing	this is in SR's view, purely an economic issue / SR thinks there’s a moral dimension to it	3
You didn’t want to be a burden on the state	in terms of the morality of this, we have to be careful of stigmatising debt and remember the creative aspect of credit	3
JL doesn’t buy that at all	JL's actually financing lifestyles that people can’t actually afford	3
you don’t need it, anyway	the push is coming from the people with the money	3
they’re not going to do it on their own	since the Council of Nicaea, in 325, made usury illegal, and it stayed that way for about 1,200 years in Europe, there have been moral questions surrounding borrowing and lending	3
What is actually happening is that people are choosing to pay down their long-term debt, their credit cards and their bank loans	one of the problems we’re facing now is the fact that organisations, and indeed people who require debt, that what we’re doing is rolling everything over	3
The problem is that so much debt has been acquired that has gone towards non-productive usage	they will take no responsibility for society	3
This stopped not because of the big bang, which liberalised banking, which is what everybody thinks	JL doesn’t buy that at all	3
